abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

The present study tests two hypotheses: (1) Between-person differences in resting RSA are related to emotional reactivity, and (2) within-person changes in RSA are related to regulatory efforts. Pairs of women watched an upsetting film and discussed it. One woman in each of the experimental dyads was asked to either suppress or to reappraise during the conversation. Their partners and both members of the control dyads conversed naturally. Between-person differences in resting RSA were assessed with paced breathing, and within-person changes in RSA were calculated from baseline to the conversation accounting for respiration. Women with higher resting RSA experienced and expressed more negative emotion, and women who attempted to regulate their emotions either by suppressing or reappraising showed larger increases in RSA than controls.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been substantial support for heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) as a treatment for a variety of disorders and for performance enhancement (Gevirtz, 2013). Since conditions as widely varied as asthma and depression seem to respond to this form of cardiorespiratory feedback training, the issue of possible mechanisms becomes more salient. The most supported possible mechanism is the strengthening of homeostasis in the baroreceptor (Vaschillo et al., 2002; Lehrer et al., 2003). Recently, the effect on the vagal afferent pathway to the frontal cortical areas has been proposed. In this article, we review these and other possible mechanisms that might explain the positive effects of HRVB.},

Perhaps the function of a partially out-of-phase phase relationship is to allow the greatest degree of flexibility to the organism,



At resting respira-tory rates, the phase relationship between breathing and HR is far from synchronous, such that heart rate increases tend to follow
inhalation at about the mid-breath point, and heart rate decreases follow exhalation also at about the mid-breath point (Vaschillo
et al., 2002).

Chaotic pattern of HRV: These can be described as “negative feedback loops,” which operate as closed loop system components that help maintain allostatic balance, while allowing adaptation to environmental demands (Lehrer and Eddie, 2013).

heart rate oscillations grows to many times the amplitude

gas exchange at the alveoli is most efficient when heart rate starts
increasing at the beginning of inhalation, and starts decreasing
just as exhalation starts, i.e., a 0◦ phase relationship.


Respiratory sinus arrhythmia also can reflect aspects of auto-nomic function. It is controlled entirely by the vagus nerve,
such that vagus nerve outputs to the sinoatrial node primarily
occur only during exhalation.

abstract = {We believe that the missing keystone to design effective and efficient biofeedback and neurofeedback protocols is a comprehensive model of the mechanisms of feedback learning. In this manuscript we review the learning models in behavioral, developmental and cognitive psychology, and derive a synthetic model of the psychological perspective on biofeedback. We afterwards review the neural correlates of feedback learning mechanisms, and present a general neuroscience model of biofeedback. We subsequently show how biomedical engineering principles can be applied to design efficient feedback protocols. We finally present an integrative psychoengineering model of the feedback learning processes, and provide new guidelines for the efficient design of biofeedback and neurofeedback protocols. We identify five key properties, (1) perceptibility??=??can the subject perceive the biosignal?, (2) autonomy??=??can the subject regulate by himself?, (3) mastery??=??degree of control over the biosignal, (4) motivation??=??rewards system of the biofeedback, and (5) learnability??=??possibility of learning. We conclude with guidelines for the investigation and promotion of these properties in biofeedback protocols.},
annote = {pre and post biof training one should measure subjective perception of self-control/biofeedback skills (discrimination and self-maintanence) and strategies

The existing literature presents contradictory theories about the
effects of biofeedback: it is either attributed to volitional control over the biological variables (involving executive function) or to autonomic regulation of subcognitive systems. 

cognitive and infra-cognitive model - more visible in neurofeedback studies

a recent manuscript suggested that neurofeed- back relies on a top-down processing mechanism, where higher cognitive functions percolate down from large-scale oscillations to small-scale and single-neuronal activities (Bagdasaryan and Le Van Quyen, 2013)

dual process theory (Wood, 2014): into two main types of processing: more automatic and capacity- free processes vs. more controlled and capacity-limited processes.

Connectionist model: postulate the existence of interactions between these two types of process- ing. From this perspective, biofeedback could be considered as a self-investigation tool, where the patient improves his volitional control over autonomic mechanisms (Zolten, 1989).

Definitions:
discrimination: perception of the target biological
self-maintanance: action over the biological variable variable
Successful training: in either or both of these skills would lead to improved balance in the biologi- cal variable for patients suffering from medical conditions involving that variable, and the positive effect should remain when the feed- back is turned off (otherwise the patient would be dependent upon the feedback system).

OC {\&} Reenforcement Learning
RL can be model based or model free (only associations)
model based: subject knows that she is learning(seeks a goal)
model free: implicit learning
problem -{\textgreater} : interpretation of the signal would depend upon the motivational state of the subject 

one can look at biofeedback from an aspect of schematas, different types of memory models,.. for summary of keypoint see table 1 pg 905. 

external feedback is important

best model which bridge the grasp of amon BIOMEDICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, NEUROSCIENTIFIC, and BIOENGINEERING perspectives.

An efficient biofeedback system controls for: PERCEPTIBILITY, AUTONOMY, MASTERY, MOTIVATION, LEARNABILITY

definitions:
Perceptibility: the potential for the subject to access the perception of the biosignal he/she has to regulate. 
Autonomy: the potential for the subject to regulate the biosignal by himself, without the help of biofeedback, once the training protocol is over. 
Mastery: the degree of control the subject can exercise over the biosignal. 
Motivation: the reward system of the biofeedback device—the reinforcement signal that will induce learning. 
Learnability: the conditions for achieving long-term memory formation (e.g., sufficient amount of time and repetitions) and to the possibility of learning itself.

Develpoing a general feedback learning experience scale involving the main items of all five properties may provide us with a new and useful direction in biofeedback research.

to improve perceptibility in explicit models: provide multimodal feedbacks (Lotte et al., 2013): each sensory modal- ity would correspond to a different slave subsystem of working memory. Consequently, a sensory modality not involved in the task should be preferred in the feedback design.

Perceptibility is analougous with cognitive load - be measured using scales such as the NASA TLX (Hart and Staveland, 1988) while the subject performs the feedback learning task.

one must demonstrate that the (bio)signal is indeed correlated with biosignal regulation.

Finally, evaluating internal feedback is an observability issue:
without the presence of internal feedback there is nothing to be learned. This evaluation can be achieved using psychophysiological scales measuring perception of the internal biosignal: subjects with a complete infirmity in the trained biosignal regulation would not be good candidates for a neurofeedback procedure (since they will never be able to develop autonomy, as explained in the next section). 

Inter-individual differ- ences in the ability to monitor interoceptive signals, to concentrate on one's own internal representations and inhibit external, task- irrelevant, stimulation, should be tracked (Inter-individual differ- ences in the ability to monitor interoceptive signals, to concentrate on one's own internal representations and inhibit external, task- irrelevant, stimulation, should be tracked (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Burgess et al., 2007).

solution to achive progressive difficulty: to estimate a psy-chophysiological curve of subject performance during a calibration
phase.

A sense of fluency can be measured using scales such as SCS
(Dong et al., 2015) or equivalent standardized measures. Task per- formance (such as biosignal modulation ability) or cognitive load physiological markers (such as galvanic skin response, or CNV in Cz) are objective but indirect indicator of mastery, and should follow a U-shaped evolution (Pauls et al., 2013; Siegler, 2004; Gevensleben et al., 2014) in explicit feedback protocols. most studies investigate performances before and after feedback administration, instead of during – and are therefore ignoring this issue. Note how- ever that this U-shaped evolution might not be observed in implicit reward feedback systems, as the subject is not focusing his atten- tion directly onto the feedback.


items from standardized flow-state evaluation
scales such as the FSSOT (Yoshida et al., 2013) or equivalent stan-dardized measures.

Important criteria for participant inclusion: Learnibility - ptp have to be able to control their biosignal at least for some extent - otherwise they won't be able to learn it at all Screening is necesarry therefore: by determining the subject's fluency with- out feedback before training begins, which can be measured using scales such as the SCS (Dong et al., 2015).

definition of performance in biofeedback training: neurofeedback is usually defined as the ability to up-regulate the targeted neuromarker during feedback training sessions (Escolano et al., 2012; Witte et al., 2013; Zoefel et al., 2011; Reichert et al., 2015; Escolano et al., 2011).

For other types of biofeedback, learnability could be measured
by evaluating the modulation performance of the subject during the first training sessions: a low initial performance in explicit biofeed- back (i.e. an absence of improvement, or an absence of aptitude to modulate the biosignal) would indicate poor learnability.


The
number of sessions, session duration, and time intervals between
sessions are therefore all crucial parameters of biofeedback and
neurofeedback protocols, and the long-term effects of feedback
training should be evaluated to determine training stability.

bioengineering approach:
process control theories{\textgreater}{\textgreater} biomedical engineering models was first suggested by Norbert Wiener in 1948 who introduced cybernetics to model self-regulating mechanisms (Wiener, 1948 2nd revised ed. 1961; Mindell, 2002; Ross Ashby, 1956), and was soon identified as a framework to model biofeed- back (Anliker, 1977). It is now commonly used to model systems biology (Cosentino and Bates, 2011), see more fig 9. pg 904

conrollability: the ability to control the internal state of a system from an initial state to a final state in a finite time interval (Kalman, 1960).
Observability: the current state can be determined in a finite time using only its outputs, for any possible sequence of states and control (Kalman,

Biofeedback can be explicit or implicit (Dekker and Champion,
2007; Kuikkaniemi et al., 2010; Nacke et al., 2011); we will first provide a model for explicit biofeedback (see Fig. 8). In this model, both internal and external functions are used to control the current state of the system as compared to the target state

important: Linearity Linear process control models are generally only applicable to
linear systems, and when applied to non-linear systems, defini- tions are only valid for small movements in the neighborhood of a functioning point (Trentelman et al., 2001). Physiological regula- tion is typically non-linear, and consequently, biofeedback systems need to be individually calibrated, with each user having his own functioning point depending upon both his physiology and his proficiency at regulating the biosignal of interest. Furthermore, the regulation task should also target small enough variations in performances to prevent non-linearity effects. In addition, neu- rophysiological regulation is allostatic (Sterling, 2004): the brain performs predictive regulations and retune its parameters accord- ing to changes. Therefore, experimental protocols should take into account the fact that individuals' reference point may vary over time depending on task demands and learning.

temporality:. Consequently, contin- uous feedback about transient states is usually more efficient than discrete feedback about steady-state errors, unless steady-state error perception is not readily available to subjects

precision:
by its ability to reach a zero steady-state error (Levine, 2010). ie the precision of biosignal monitoring, the subject's perfor- mance with or without feedback) should be avaluated},

It has been suggested that lonely individuals suffer from a cognitive bias towards social threatening stimuli. However, current models of loneliness remain vague on how this cognitive bias is expressed in lonely individuals. The current review provides an up-to-date overview of studies examining loneliness in relation to various aspects of cognitive functioning. These studies are interpreted in light of the Social Information Processing (SIP) model. A wide range of studies indicate that lonely individuals have a negative cognitive bias in all stages of SIP. More specifically, lonely individuals have an increased attention for social threatening stimuli, hold negative and hostile intent attributions, expect rejection, evaluate themselves and others negatively, endorse less promotion- and more prevention-oriented goals, and have a low self-efficacy. This negative cognitive bias seems specific to the social context. Avenues for future research and implications for clinical practice are discussed.},

In Experiment 1, subjects rated the pleasure and arousal elicited when listening to each of 60 sounds, followed by an incidental free recall task. The shape of the two-dimensional affective space defined by the mean ratings for each sound was similar to that previously obtained for pictures, and, like memory for pictures, free recall was highest for emotionally arousing stimuli. In Experiment 2, autonomic and facial electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded while a new group of subjects listened to the same set of sounds; the startle reflex was measured using visual probes. Listening to unpleasant sounds resulted in larger startle reflexes, more corrugator EMG activity, and larger heart rate deceleration compared with listening to pleasant sounds. Electrodermal reactions were larger for emotionally arousing than for neutral materials. Taken together, the data suggest that acoustic cues activate the appetitive and defensive motivational circuits underlying emotional expression in ways similar to pictures.},

We also looked at how attentional control in the processing of fearful, happy, and neutral expressions relates to individual differences in trait anxiety in these adolescent groups. We were able to show that younger adolescents, but not older adolescents had more difficulties with attention control in the presence of all faces, but particularly in the presence of fearful faces. Moreover, we found that across all groups, adolescents with higher trait anxiety exhibited attentional avoidance of all faces, which facilitated relatively better performance on the primary task. These differences in reaction time emerged in the context of comparable accuracy level in the primary task across age-groups. Our results contribute to our understanding of how attentional control abilities to faces but in particular fearful expressions may mature across adolescence.

Both ERP components were modulated by emotional arousal, with ERPs elicited when viewing pleasant and unpleasant pictures different than when viewing neutral pictures. On the other hand, repetition had different effects on these two components. The early occipitotemporal component (150-300 msec) primarily showed a decrease in amplitude within a block of repetitions that did not differ as a function of picture content. The late centroparietal component (300-600 msec) showed a decrease both between and within blocks of repetitions, with neutral pictures eliciting no late positive potential in the final block of the study.

Studies of face-recognition suggest that visual recognition of stored visual features inform self-face recognition. In contrast, body-recognition studies conclude that multisensory integration is the main cue to selfhood. The present study investigates for the first time the specific contribution of current multisensory input for self-face recognition. Participants were stroked on their face while they were looking at a morphed face being touched in synchrony or asynchrony. Before and after the visuo-tactile stimulation participants performed a self-recognition task. The results show that multisensory signals have a significant effect on self-face recognition. Synchronous tactile stimulation while watching another person's face being similarly touched produced a bias in recognizing one's own face, in the direction of the other person included in the representation of one's own face. Multisensory integration can update cognitive representations of one's body, such as the sense of ownership. The present study extends this converging evidence by showing that the correlation of synchronous multisensory signals also updates the representation of one's face. The face is a key feature of our identity, but at the same time is a source of rich multisensory experiences used to maintain or update self-representations.},

abstract = {When regulating negative emotional reactions, one goal is to reduce physiological reactions. However, not all regulation strategies succeed in doing that. We tested whether heart rate biofeedback helped participants reduce physiological reactions in response to negative and neutral pictures. When viewing neutral pictures, participants could regulate their heart rate whether the heart rate feedback was real or not. In contrast, when viewing negative pictures, participants could regulate heart rate only when feedback was real. Ratings of task success paralleled heart rate. Participants' general level of anxiety, emotion awareness, or cognitive emotion regulation strategies did not influence the results. Our findings show that accurate online heart rate biofeedback provides an efficient way to down-regulate autonomic physiological reactions when encountering negative stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

According to their results in a heartbeat perception task, subjects were classified as good (n=18) or poor (n=26) heartbeat perceivers. EEG, EOG, and ECG were recorded while participants attended to their heartbeats. The R-wave of the ECG served as a trigger for EEG averaging. In the latency range of 250-350 ms after the ECG R-wave, the HEP amplitude at the right central location was significantly higher in good heartbeat perceivers. A significantly positive correlation was observed between the heartbeat perception score and the mean HEP amplitude. Our results confirm that the accuracy of heartbeat perception is reflected in the amplitude of the HEP. Thus, the HEP may be a suitable research tool for the study of brain processes related to visceral perception.},

Although conducting a “mini meta” within one's manuscript has been argued for in the past, this practice is still relatively rare and adoption is slow. We believe two deterrents are responsible. First, researchers may not think that it is legitimate to do a meta-analysis on a small number of studies. Second, researchers may think a meta-analysis is too complicated to do without expert knowledge or guidance. We dispel these two misconceptions by (1) offering arguments on why researchers should be encouraged to do mini metas, (2) citing previous articles that have conducted such analyses to good effect, and (3) providing a user-friendly guide on calculating some meta- analytic procedures that are appropriate when there are only a few studies. We provide formulas for calculating effect sizes and converting effect sizes from one metric to another (e.g., from Cohen's d to r), as well as annotated Excel spreadsheets and a step-by-step guide on how to conduct a simple meta-analysis. A series of related studies can be strengthened and better understood if accompanied by a mini meta-analysis. How},

abstract = {Measuring brain activity simultaneously from two people interacting is intuitively appealing if one is interested in putative neural markers of social interaction. However, given the complex nature of two-person interactions, it has proven difficult to carry out two-person brain imaging experiments in a methodologically feasible and conceptually relevant way. Only a small number of recent studies have put this into practice, using fMRI, EEG, or NIRS. Here, we review two main two-brain methodological approaches, each with two conceptual strategies. The first group has employed simultaneous fMRI recordings, studying a) turn-based interactions on the order of seconds, or b) pseudo-interactive scenarios, where only one person is scanned at a time, investigating the flow of information between brains. The second group of studies has recorded dual EEG/NIRS from two people interacting, in a) face-to-face turn-based interactions, investigating functional connectivity between theory-of-mind regions of interacting partners, or in b) continuous mutual interactions on millisecond timescales, to measure coupling between the activity in one person's brain and the activity in the other's brain. We discuss the questions these approaches have addressed, and consider scenarios when simultaneous two-brain recordings are needed. Furthermore, we suggest that a) quantification of inter-personal neural effects via measures of emergence, and b) multivariate decoding models that generalize source-specific features of interaction, may provide novel tools to study brains in interaction. This may allow for a better understanding of social cognition as both representation and participation.},

abstract = {The vagal (high frequency [HF]) component of heart rate variability (HRV) predicts survival in post-myocardial infarction patients and is considered to reflect vagal antagonism of sympathetic influences. Previous studies of the neural correlates of vagal tone involved mental stress tasks that included cognitive and emotional elements. To differentiate the neural substrates of vagal tone due to emotion, we correlated HF-HRV with measures of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) derived from positron emission tomography (PET) and 15O-water in 12 healthy women during different emotional states. Happiness, sadness, disgust and three neutral conditions were each induced by film clips and recall of personal experiences (12 conditions). Inter-beat intervals derived from electrocardiographic recordings during the 60-second scans were spectrally-analyzed, generating 12 separate measures of HF-HRV in each subject. The six emotion and six neutral conditions were grouped together and contrasted. We observed substantial overlap between emotion-specific rCBF and the correlation between emotion-specific rCBF and HF-HRV, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex. Emotion-specific rCBF also correlated with HF-HRV in the caudate nucleus, periacqueductal gray and left mid-insula. We also observed that the elements of cognitive control inherent in this experiment (that involved focusing on the target mental state) had definable neural substrates that correlated with HF-HRV and to a large extent differed from the emotion-specific correlates of HF-HRV. No statistically significant asymmetries were observed. Our findings are consistent with the view that the medial visceromotor network is a final common pathway by which emotional and cognitive functions recruit autonomic support. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

Results support the use of nonlinear models for interpersonal linkage ef-fects of this type.

abstract = {Research indicates that coactors performing cooperative tasks often exhibit spontaneous and unintended similarities in their physiological and behavioral responses—a phenomenon referred to here as physio-behavioral coupling (PBC). The purpose of this research was to identify contributors to PBC; examine relationships between PBC, team performance, and perceived team attributes (e.g., cohesion, trust); and compare a set of time-series measures(cross-correlation [CC], cross-recurrence quantification analysis [CRQA], and cross-fuzzy entropy [CFEn]) in their characterization of PBC across comparisons. To accomplish this, PBC was examined in human postural sway (PS) and cardiac interbeat intervals (IBIs) from dyadic teams performing a fast-paced puzzle task (Quadra—a variant of the video game Tetris). Results indicated that observed levels of PBC were not a chance occurrence, but instead driven by features of the team-task environment, and that PBC was likely influenced by similar individual task demands and interpersonal coordination dynamics that were not " unique " to a particular team. Correla-tion analysis revealed that PBC exhibited negative relationships with team performance and team attributes, which were interpreted to reflect complementary coordination (as opposed to mimicry) during task performance, potentially due to differentiated team roles. Finally, qualitative comparison of time-series measures used to characterize PBC indicated that CRQA percent recurrence and CFEn (both nonlinear measures) settled on mostly analogous characterizations, whereas linear CC did not. The disparity observed between the linear and nonlinear measures highlights underlying computational and interpretational differences between the two families of statistics and supports the use of multiple metrics for characterizing PBC.},

Experiments H and III showed that heartbeat perception was unrelated to either initial voluntary control or learning and suggested that sampling error accounted for the negative correlation in Experiment L Experiment I also demonstrated that learned increases in HR are retained for at least 10 weeks following feedback training.

The question of how to account for and how to predict individual differ-ences in the rate of learning of autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses is important for both theoretical and applied reasons.

Field observations suggest that they may enhance social cohesion and that their effects are not limited to those actively performing but affect the audience as well. Here we show physiological effects of synchronized arousal in a Spanish fire-walking ritual, between active participants and related spectators, but not participants and other members of the audience. We assessed arousal by heart rate dynamics and applied nonlinear mathematical analysis to heart rate data obtained from 38 participants. We compared synchronized arousal between fire-walkers and spectators. For this comparison, we used recurrence quantification analysis on individual data and cross-recurrence quantification analysis on pairs of participants' data. These methods identified fine-grained commonalities of arousal during the 30-min ritual between fire-walkers and related spectators but not unrelated spectators. This indicates that the mediating mechanism may be informational, because participants and related observers had very different bodily behavior. This study demonstrates that a collective ritual may evoke synchronized arousal over time between active participants and bystanders. It links field observations to a physiological basis and offers a unique approach for the quantification of social effects on human physiology during real-world interactions.},

Multilevel modeling was used to distinguish the between- and within-individual effects of parent affect on adolescent RSA. Results indicated that observed within-parent–teen dyad anger was negatively associated with adolescent RSA, controlling for previous- minute RSA level, particularly among adolescents 13 years and older. In addition, observed between- dyad positive affect was positively linked to RSA for both boys and girls when previous-minute RSA level was controlled.

abstract = {To successfully interact with others, people automati-cally mimic their actions and feelings. Yet, neurobeha-vioral studies of interaction are few because of lacking conceptual and experimental frameworks. A recent study introduced an elegantly simple motor task to unravel implicit interpersonal behavioral synchrony and brain function during face-to-face interaction. Everyday life is full of social interactions – either direct face-to-face encounters or communications mediated via, for example, mobile devices. In these interactions, people try to understand others and to get themselves understood, largely relying on unconsciously formed inferences of the other person's goals and intentions. Mutual understanding requires a certain level of be-tween-participant similarity in perception and action. For example, comprehension of a verbal message is associated with enhanced synchrony between the brains of the speak-er and listener [1]. Along similar lines, brain activity becomes temporally synchronized on time scales of a few seconds in individuals who passively view naturalistic stimuli, such as movies [2], with strengthened synchroni-zation when the viewed events are accompanied by strong emotions [3]. In interaction situations, people often auto-matically adopt other persons' postures and movement patterns [4], which leads to synchronization of, for in-stance, walking rhythm, bodily sway, and gesturing. Such unconscious 'mirroring' of other people's actions likely helps to share feelings and goals. Altogether, human brains and minds are not as private as traditionally thought. Despite the complexity of naturalistic environments, humans are extremely skilful in forming quick impressions of other people and in following their actions. Still, the brain mechanisms underlying inter-subject coordination and cooperation are poorly understood, largely because of the methodological difficulties related to the complex dy-namics of interaction situations. 'Two-person neuroscience' (2PN), which records brain activity from two persons at the same time, might provide the necessary methodological and conceptual leaps from the level of individuals to dyads [5,6]. Although reactions to socially relevant stimuli, such as faces, can be easily studied in single-person settings, brain phenomena related to swift social interaction can be captured only when two subjects are studied simultaneously. Yun and colleagues [7] recently addressed implicit in-terpersonal interaction by asking two persons to keep their index fingers directed to the finger of the other person in a face-to-face setting. In a training session, one of the sub-jects served as the leader, moving his/her index finger within a 20 {\^{A}} 20-cm 2 square, and the other person followed the movements. The test-session instruction was to just look at the other person's finger while holding one's own finger stationary. However, the participants tended to unconsciously synchronize the positions of their finger-tips, which did not happen after non-social control training with light dots. The authors interpreted the increased synchrony between the finger positions of the two participants to be a 'measurable basis of implicit social interaction'. These behavioral results are interesting per se, as they reveal a tendency for automatic synchronization with others' actions. However, Yun and colleagues went further and also measured scalp EEG simultaneously from the two subjects to identify the brain correlates of the synchroni-zation. Importantly, EEG (as well as MEG) has millisecond time resolution and is a direct measure of neural activity. Yun and collaborators found that intersubject behavioral synchronization (that was increased after the training task) was associated with increased inter-brain, but not intra-brain, phase locking in the theta (4–7.5 Hz) and beta (12–30 Hz) bands. The simple synchrony task employed by Yun and colla-borators is a welcome addition to the limited behavioral repertoire of paradigms to quantify interpersonal synchro-nization. However, the interpretation of the results raises several questions. Participants engaged in a smooth social interaction may enter co-leadership states, where neither of them is leading or following [8], which results in zero-lag correlations, taken by Yun et al. to imply non-intentionality of following. However, intentional entrainment or mutual adaptation during the task can have similar outcomes [9]. It also remains an open question whether the behavioral synchrony in this study increased because of co-operative interaction during the training, as suggested, or whether the training task in fact trained the subjects to ideomotorically follow the other person's finger movements.},

abstract = {Studies demonstrating a mnemonic benefit for encoding words in a survival scenario have revived interest in how human memory is shaped by evolutionary pressures. Prior work on the survival-processing advantage has largely examined cognitive factors as potential proximate mechanisms. The current study, by contrast, focused on the role of perceived threat. Guided by the idea that a survival scenario implies threat, we combined measures of heart rate (HR) with affective ratings to probe the potential presence of fear bradycardia as a marker of freezing—a parasympathetically dominated HR deceleration that reflects the initial stage of the defensive engagement. We replicated the mnemonic advantage in behavior and found that the survival scenario was rated higher in perceived negative arousal than a commonly used control scenario. Critically, words encountered in the survival scenario were associated with more extensive HR deceleration, and this effect was directly related to subsequent recall performance. Our findings point to a role for the involvement of neurobiological fear responses in producing the survival processing advantage, as well as potential links between autonomic changes and cognitive processing in adaptive memory.},

abstract = {This paper describes the R package crqa to perform cross-recurrence quantification analysis of two time series of either a categorical or continuous nature. Streams of behavioral information, from eye movements to linguistic elements, unfold over time. When two people interact, such as in conversation, they often adapt to each other, leading these behavioral levels to exhibit recurrent states. In dialog, for example, interlocutors adapt to each other by exchanging interactive cues: smiles, nods, gestures, choice of words, and so on. In order for us to capture closely the goings-on of dynamic interaction, and uncover the extent of coupling between two individuals, we need to quantify how much recurrence is taking place at these levels. Methods available in crqa would allow researchers in cognitive science to pose such questions as how much are two people recurrent at some level of analysis, what is the characteristic lag time for one person to maximally match another, or whether one person is leading another. First, we set the theoretical ground to understand the difference between "correlation" and "co-visitation" when comparing two time series, using an aggregative or cross-recurrence approach. Then, we describe more formally the principles of cross-recurrence, and show with the current package how to carry out analyses applying them. We end the paper by comparing computational efficiency, and results' consistency, of crqa R package, with the benchmark MATLAB toolbox crptoolbox (Marwan, 2013). We show perfect comparability between the two libraries on both levels.},

abstract = {Many factors contribute to the severity of neuronal cell death and the functional outcome in stroke. We describe an embolic model of focal cerebral ischemia in the rat that does not require craniotomy and is compatible with continuous measurement of regional CBF using multichannel laser Doppler flow (LDF) technique. Either a 22 microliters (large lesion) or 11 microliters (small lesion) bolus of viscous silicone was injected cephalad into the internal carotid artery. Upon injection, LDF decreased abruptly, most severely in the parietal cortex (-74{\%} 5{\%}) in the large lesion and in the occipital cortex (-69{\%} 10{\%}) in the small lesion model. Over the first hour, post-embolization LDF improved in most areas (e.g. -48{\%} 9{\%} parietal, large lesion) but declined in the small lesion group in the occipital region (-81{\%} 8{\%}). CBF measured by C14-IAP autoradiography 1 h post-embolization in the large lesion model demonstrated near-hemispheric ischemia (70{\%} of hemisphere) with sparing of cingulate cortex. Autoradiography demonstrated that ischemia in the small lesion was largely cortical. Light microscopy of brains embolized with 11 microliters of dyed silicone showed filling of pial vessels with no silicone in the Circle of Willis or parenchyma. No animals in the large lesion group survived 24 h. Thirteen of 15 animals in the small lesion group survived for two weeks with resolution of initial hemiplegia, ocular asymmetry and weight loss. Hematoxylin-eosin staining two weeks post-embolization showed signs of severe hypoxia and infarction. In conclusion, the intracarotid silicone embolization technique produces a titrable, reproducible permanent ischemic injury by blocking perfusion in the pial circulation, and is amenable to multisite monitoring with laser Doppler flowmetry. The smaller embolus produces cortical infarction with high rate of survival and neurological recovery.},

abstract = {A consensual, componential model of emotions conceptualises them as experiential, physiological, and behavioural responses to personally meaningful stimuli. The present review examines this model in terms of whether different types of emotion-evocative stimuli are associated with discrete and invariant patterns of responding in each response system, how such responses are structured, and if such responses converge across different response systems. Across response systems, the bulk of the available evidence favours the idea that measures of emotional responding reflect dimensions rather than discrete states. In addition, experiential, physiological, and behavioural response systems are associated with unique sources of variance, which in turn limits the magnitude of convergence across measures. Accordingly, the authors suggest that there is no "gold standard" measure of emotional responding. Rather, experiential, physiological, and behavioural measures are all relevant to understanding emotion and cannot be assumed to be interchangeable.},

After an overview of those metrics, and a discussion of potential confounds and extraneous influences, an empirical examination of the relationships amongst these metrics is provided. This study examined 10 metrics in 96 unselected college students under conditions of resting baseline and serial paced arithmetic. Intercorrelations between metrics were very high. Factor analyses were conducted on the metrics reflecting variability in cardiac rate, once at baseline and again during mental arithmetic. Factor structure was highly stable across tasks, and included a factor that had high loadings of all variables except Toichi's "cardiac sympathetic index" (CSI), and a second factor that was defined predominantly by the CSI. Although generally highly correlated, the various metrics responded differently under challenge. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Why does hearing a window squeaking in the night suggest to us the unlikely idea of a thief or a killer? And why is this more likely to happen after watching a horror movie? To answer these and similar questions, we need to put mind and body together again and consider the embodied nature of perceptual and cognitive inference. Predictive coding provides a general framework for perceptual inference; I propose to extend it by including interoceptive and bodily information. The resulting embodied predictive coding inference permits one to compare alternative hypotheses (e.g., is the sound I hear generated by a thief or the wind?) using the same inferential scheme as in predictive coding, but using both sensory and interoceptive information as evidence, rather than just considering sensory events. If you hear a window squeaking in the night after watching a horror movie, you may consider plausible a very unlikely hypothesis (e.g., a thief, or even the bogeyman) because it explains both what you sense (e.g., the window squeaking in the night) and how you feel (e.g., your high heart rate). The good news is that the inference that I propose is fully rational and gives minds and bodies equal dignity. The bad news is that it also gives an embodiment to the bogeyman, and a reason to fear it.},

The theories suggest that perceiving and thinking about emotion involve perceptual, somatovisceral, and motoric reexperiencing (collectively referred to as "embodiment") of the relevant emotion in one's self. The embodiment of emotion, when induced in human participants by manipulations of facial expression and posture in the laboratory, causally affects how emotional information is processed. Congruence between the recipient's bodily expression of emotion and the sender's emotional tone of language, for instance, facilitates comprehension of the communication, whereas incongruence can impair comprehension.

abstract = {Joint Action is typically described as social interaction that requires coordination among two or more co-actors in order to achieve a common goal. In this article, we put forward a hypothesis for the existence of a neural-computational mechanism of affective valuation that may be critically exploited in Joint Action. Such a mechanism would serve to facilitate coordination between co-actors permitting a reduction of required information. Our hypothesized affective mechanism provides a value function based implementation of Associative Two-Process (ATP) theory that entails the classification of external stimuli according to outcome expectancies. This approach has been used to describe animal and human action that concerns differential outcome expectancies. Until now it has not been applied to social interaction. We describe our Affective ATP model as applied to social learning consistent with an “extended common currency” perspective in the social neuroscience literature. We contrast this to an alternative mechanism that provides an example implementation of the so-called social-specific value perspective. In brief, our Social-Affective ATP mechanism builds upon established formalisms for reinforcement learning (temporal difference learning models) nuanced to accommodate expectations (consistent with ATP theory) and extended to integrate non-social and social cues for use in Joint Action.},

abstract = {Can viewing others experiencing stress create a "contagious" physiological stress response in the observer? To investigate second-hand stress, we first created a stimulus set of videos, which featured participants speaking under either minimal stress, high stress, or while recovering from stress. We then recruited a second set of participants to watch these videos. All participants (speakers and observers) were monitored via electrocardiogram. Cardiac activity of the observers while watching the videos was then analyzed and compared to that of the speakers. Furthermore, we assessed dispositional levels of empathy in observers to determine how empathy might be related to the degree of stress contagion. Results revealed that depending on the video being viewed, observers experienced differential changes in cardiac activity that were based on the speaker's stress level. Additionally, this is the first demonstration that individuals high in dispositional empathy experience these physiological changes more quickly.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that reappraisal strategies are more effective than suppression strategies for regulating emotions. Recently, proponents of the acceptance-based behavior therapy movement have further emphasized the importance of acceptance-based emotion regulation techniques. In order to directly compare these different emotion regulation strategies, 202 volunteers were asked to give an impromptu speech in front of a video camera. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The Reappraisal group was instructed to regulate their anxious arousal by reappraising the situation; the Suppression group was asked to suppress their anxious behaviors; and the Acceptance group was instructed to accept their anxiety. As expected, the Suppression group showed a greater increase in heart rate from baseline than the Reappraisal and Acceptance groups. Moreover, the Suppression group reported more anxiety than the Reappraisal group. However, the Acceptance and Suppression groups did not differ in their subjective anxiety response. These results suggest that both reappraising and accepting anxiety is more effective for moderating the physiological arousal than suppressing anxiety. However, reappraising is more effective for moderating the subjective feeling of anxiety than attempts to suppress or accept it. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The sense of body-ownership relies on the representation of both interoceptive and exteroceptive signals coming from one's body. However, it remains unknown how the integration of bodily signals coming from " outside " and " inside " the body is instantiated in the brain. Here, we used a modified version of the Enfacement Illusion to investigate whether the integration of visual and cardiac information can alter self-face recognition (Experiment 1) and neural responses to heartbeats (Experiment 2). We projected a pulsing shade, that was synchronous or asynchronous with the participant's heartbeat, onto a picture depicting the participant's face morphed with the face of an unfamiliar other. Results revealed that synchronous (vs. asynchronous) cardio-visual stimulation led to increased self-identification with the other's face (Experiment 1), while during stimulation, synchronicity modulated the amplitude of the Heartbeat Evoked Potential, an electrophysiological index of cortical interoceptive processing (Experiment 2). Importantly, the magnitude of the illusion-related effects was dependent on, and increased linearly, with the participants' Interoceptive Accuracy. These results provide the first direct neural evidence for the integration of interoceptive and exteroceptive signals in bodily self-awareness.},

abstract = {The intimate connection between the brain and the heart was enunciated by Claude Bernard over 150 years ago. In our neurovisceral integration model we have tried to build on this pioneering work. In the present paper we further elaborate our model and update it with recent results. Specifically, we performed a meta-analysis of recent neuroimaging studies on the relationship between heart rate variability and regional cerebral blood flow. We identified a number of regions, including the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, in which significant associations across studies were found. We further propose that the default response to uncertainty is the threat response and may be related to the well known negativity bias. Heart rate variability may provide an index of how strongly 'top-down' appraisals, mediated by cortical-subcortical pathways, shape brainstem activity and autonomic responses in the body. If the default response to uncertainty is the threat response, as we propose here, contextual information represented in 'appraisal' systems may be necessary to overcome this bias during daily life. Thus, HRV may serve as a proxy for 'vertical integration' of the brain mechanisms that guide flexible control over behavior with peripheral physiology, and as such provides an important window into understanding stress and health. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Rainville2006a,
abstract = {The existence of specific somatic states associated with different emotions remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the profile of cardiorespiratory activity during the experience of fear, anger, sadness and happiness. ECG and respiratory activity was recorded in 43 healthy volunteers during the recall and experiential reliving of one or two potent emotional autobiographical episodes and a neutral episode. Univariate statistics indicated that the four emotions differed from each other and from the neutral control condition on several linear and spectral indices of cardiorespiratory activity. Dependent variables were further reduced to five physiologically meaningful factors using an exploratory principal component analysis (PCA). Multivariate analyses of variance and effect size estimates calculated on those factors confirmed the differences between the four emotion conditions. A stepwise discriminant analyses predicting emotions using the PCA factors led to a classification rate of 65.3{\%} for the four emotions (chance = 25{\%}; p = 0.001) and of 72.0-83.3{\%} for pair-wise discrimination (chance = 50{\%}; p's {\textless} 0.05). These findings may be considered preliminary in view of the small sample on which the multivariate approach has been applied. However, this study emphasizes the need to better characterize the multidimensional factors involved in cardio-respiratory regulation during emotion. These results are consistent with the notion that distinct patterns of peripheral physiological activity are associated with different emotions. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The human brain protects the processing of task-relevant stimuli from interference ("conflict") by task-irrelevant stimuli via attentional biasing mechanisms. The lateral prefrontal cortex has been implicated in resolving conflict between competing stimuli by selectively enhancing task-relevant stimulus representations in sensory cortices. Conversely, recent data suggest that conflict from emotional distracters may be resolved by an alternative route, wherein the rostral anterior cingulate cortex inhibits amygdalar responsiveness to task-irrelevant emotional stimuli. Here we tested the proposal of 2 dissociable, distracter-specific conflict resolution mechanisms, by acquiring functional magnetic resonance imaging data during resolution of conflict from either nonemotional or emotional distracters. The results revealed 2 distinct circuits: a lateral prefrontal "cognitive control" system that resolved nonemotional conflict and was associated with enhanced processing of task-relevant stimuli in sensory cortices, and a rostral anterior cingulate "emotional control" system that resolved emotional conflict and was associated with decreased amygdalar responses to emotional distracters. By contrast, activations related to both emotional and nonemotional conflict monitoring were observed in a common region of the dorsal anterior cingulate. These data suggest that the neuroanatomical networks recruited to overcome conflict vary systematically with the nature of the conflict, but that they may share a common conflict-detection mechanism.},

A facilitated response to probes that appear at the same location of threat information in comparison with responses to probes at the opposite location of threat information is interpreted as vigilance for threat. We argue that the findings in the dot probe paradigm are ambiguous evidence for the vigilance to threat hypothesis. Results can also be interpreted as a difficulty to disengage from threat. In this study, 44 undergraduates performed a pictorial version of the probe detection task. Taking into account the reaction times on neutral trials, we found no evidence for a facilitated detection of threatening information. It was found that the dot probe effects are at least partially due to disengagement effects.

Using neuro-imaging of subjects in isolation, the former approach has provided knowledge on the neural underpinning of a variety of social processes. However, it has been argued that considering one brain alone cannot account for all mechanisms subtending online social interaction. This challenge has been tackled recently by using neuro-imaging of multiple interacting subjects in more ecological settings. The present short review aims at offering a comprehensive view on various advances done in the last decade. We provide a taxonomy of existing research in neuroscience of social interaction, situating them in the frame of general organization principles of social cognition. Finally, we discuss the putative enabling role of emerging non-local social mechanisms-such as interpersonal brain and body coupling-in processes underlying our ability to create a shared world.},

abstract = {Unlike visual stimuli, little attention has been paid to auditory stimuli in terms of emotion prediction with physiological signals. This paper aimed to investigate whether auditory stimuli can be used as an effective elicitor as visual stimuli for emotion prediction using physiological channels. For this purpose, a well-controlled experiment was designed, in which standardized visual and auditory stimuli were systematically selected and presented to participants to induce various emotions spontaneously in a laboratory setting. Numerous physiological signals, including facial electromyogram, electroencephalography, skin conductivity and respiration data, were recorded when participants were exposed to the stimulus presentation. Two data mining methods, namely decision rules and k-nearest neighbor based on the rough set technique, were applied to construct emotion prediction models based on the features extracted from the physiological data. Experimental results demonstrated that auditory stimuli were as effective as visual stimuli in eliciting emotions in terms of systematic physiological reactivity. This was evidenced by the best prediction accuracy quantified by the F1 measure (visual: 76.2{\%} vs. auditory: 76.1{\%}) among six emotion categories (excited, happy, neutral, sad, fearful and disgusted). Furthermore, we also constructed culture-specific (Chinese vs. Indian) prediction models. The results showed that model prediction accuracy was not significantly different between culture-specific models. Finally, the implications of affective auditory stimuli in human-computer interaction, limitations of the study and suggestions for further research are discussed.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

Finding self-face recognition disorders mainly in neurological and psychiatric diseases suggests that modifying sense of identity in a simple, rapid way remains a "holy grail" for cognitive neuroscience. By touching the face of subjects who were viewing simultaneous touches on a partner's face, we induced a novel illusion of personal identity that we call "enfacement": The partner's facial features became incorporated into the representation of the participant's own face. Subjects reported that morphed images of themselves and their partner contained more self than other only after synchronous, but not asynchronous, stroking. Therefore, we modified self-face recognition by means of a simple psychophysical manipulation. While accommodating gradual change in one's own face is an important form of representational plasticity that may help maintaining identity over time, the surprisingly rapid changes induced by our procedure suggest that sense of facial identity may be more malleable than previously believed. "Enfacement" correlated positively with the participant's empathic traits and with the physical attractiveness the participants attributed to their partners. Thus, personality variables modulate enfacement, which may represent a marker of the tendency to be social and may be absent in subjects with defective empathy.},

For both husbands and wives, own cortisol level was positively associated with partner's cortisol level, even after sampling time was controlled. For wives, marital satisfaction weakened the strength of this effect. Partner's negative mood was positively associated with own negative mood for both husbands and wives. Marital satisfaction fully moderated this effect, reducing the strength of the association between one's own and one's partner's negative mood states. Spouses' positive moods were not correlated. As expected, within-couple coregulation coefficients were stronger when mood and cortisol were sampled in the early morning and evening, when spouses were together at home, than during the workday. The results suggest that spouses' fluctuations in negative mood and cortisol levels are linked over several days and that marital satisfaction may buffer spouses from their partners' negative mood or stress state.},

abstract = {Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, or high-frequency heart-rate variability) is frequently employed as an index of cardiac vagal tone or even believed to be a direct measure of vagal tone. However, there are many significant caveats regarding vagal tone interpretation:1.Respiratory parameters can confound relations between RSA and cardiac vagal tone.2.Although intraindividual relations between RSA and cardiac vagal control are often strong, interindividual associations may be modest.3.RSA measurement is profoundly influenced by concurrent levels of momentary physical activity, which can bias estimation of individual differences in vagal tone.4.RSA magnitude is affected by beta-adrenergic tone.5.RSA and cardiac vagal tone can dissociate under certain circumstances.6.The polyvagal theory contains evolution-based speculations that relate RSA, vagal tone and behavioral phenomena. We present evidence that the polyvagal theory does not accurately depict evolution of vagal control of heart-rate variability, and that it ignores the phenomenon of cardiac aliasing and disregards the evolution of a functional role for vagal control of the heart, from cardiorespiratory synchrony in fish to RSA in mammals. Unawareness of these issues can lead to misinterpretation of cardiovascular autonomic mechanisms. On the other hand, RSA has been shown to often provide a reasonable reflection of cardiac vagal tone when the above-mentioned complexities are considered. Finally, a recent hypothesis is expanded upon, in which RSA plays a primary role in regulation of energy exchange by means of synchronizing respiratory and cardiovascular processes during metabolic and behavioral change. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This theoretical model of emotion is based on research using the startle-probe methodology. It ex- plains inconsistencies in probe studies of attention and fear conditioning and provides a new ap- proach to emotional perception, imagery, and memory. Emotions are organized biphasically, as appetitive or aversive (defensive). Reflexes with the same valence as an ongoing emotional state are augmented; mismatched reflexes are inhibited. Thus, the startle response (an aversive reflex) is en- hanced during a fear state and is diminished in a pleasant emotional context. This affect-startle effect is not determined by general arousal, simple attention, or probe modality. The effect is found when affects are prompted by pictures or memory images, changes appropriately with aversive condi- tioning, and may be dependent on right-hemisphere processing. Implications for clinical, neurophys- iological, and basic research in emotion are outlined.},

abstract = {The relationship between respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and valence and arousal remains unclear. In the present study, the associations between emotion responses and tonic or task-related changes in RSA were assessed. Specifically, the sensitivities of changes in interbeat interval, RSA, and skin conductance to the valence and arousal values of emotional stimuli were examined. This study also explored the association between tonic RSA and subjective, expressive, and physiological emotional responses. Response measures were collected from 56 adults during baseline and film-viewing periods. Tonic RSA was not significantly related to any of the response measures. Increased skin conductance and decreased RSA were associated with arousal independent of valence. Interbeat interval was related to affective valence and not arousal. These findings suggest that RSA may be a useful adjunct to skin conductance measures in assessing emotional arousal.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a reliable reflection of the many physiological factors modulating the normal rhythm of the heart. In fact, they provide a powerful means of observing the interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. It shows that the structure generating the signal is not only simply linear, but also involves nonlinear contributions. Heart rate (HR) is a nonstationary signal; its variation may contain indicators of current disease, or warnings about impending cardiac diseases. The indicators may be present at all times or may occur at random—during certain intervals of the day. It is strenuous and time consuming to study and pinpoint abnormalities in voluminous data collected over several hours. Hence, HR variation analysis (instantaneous HR against time axis) has become a popular noninvasive tool for assessing the activities of the autonomic nervous system. Computer based analytical tools for in-depth study of data over daylong intervals can be very useful in diagnostics. Therefore, the HRV signal parameters, extracted and analyzed using computers, are highly useful in diagnostics. In this paper, we have discussed the various applications of HRV and different linear, frequency domain, wavelet domain, nonlinear techniques used for the analysis of the HRV.},

Recorded in parallel sessions, the slow-wave late positive potential (LPP) and visual cortical blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were both modulated by the rated intensity of picture arousal. The amplitude of the LPP correlated significantly with BOLD intensity in lateral occipital, inferotemporal, and parietal visual areas across picture contents. Estimated strength of modeled regional sources did not correlate significantly with regional BOLD intensity. These data suggest that the enhanced positive slow wave seen over posterior sites during emotional picture processing represents activity in a circuit of visual cortical structures, reflecting a perceptual sensitivity to the motivational relevance of visual scenes.},

Moreover, reflex modulation and conductance change varied with arousal, whereas facial patterns were content specific. The findings suggest that affective responses serve different functions-mobilization for action, attention, and social communication-and reflect the motivational system that is engaged, its intensity of activation, and the specific emotional context.},

abstract = {Researchers designing experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli are faced with difficult questions about optimal study design. The conventional procedures of statistical power analysis fail to provide appropriate answers to these questions because they are based on statistical models in which stimuli are not assumed to be a source of random variation in the data, models that are inappropriate for experiments involving crossed random factors of participants and stimuli. In this article, we present new methods of power analysis for designs with crossed random factors, and we give detailed, practical guidance to psychology researchers planning experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We extensively examine 5 commonly used experimental designs, describe how to estimate statistical power in each, and provide power analysis results based on a reasonable set of default parameter values. We then develop general conclusions and formulate rules of thumb concerning the optimal design of experiments in which a sample of participants responds to a sample of stimuli. We show that in crossed designs, statistical power typically does not approach unity as the number of participants goes to infinity but instead approaches a maximum attainable power value that is possibly small, depending on the stimulus sample. We also consider the statistical merits of designs involving multiple stimulus blocks. Finally, we provide a simple and flexible Web-based power application to aid researchers in planning studies with samples of stimuli.},

A total of 131 patients on weaning trials from mechanical ventilation were analyzed: 92 patients with successful weaning (group S) and 39 patients that failed to maintain spontaneous breathing (group F). The results show that parameters as determinism (DET), average diagonal line length (L), and entropy (ENTR), are statistically significant with RP for T(Tot) series, but not with HRV. When comparing the groups with JRP, all parameters have been relevant. In all cases, mean values of recurrence quantification analysis are higher in the group S than in the group F. The main differences between groups were found on the diagonal and vertical structures of the joint recurrence plot.},

abstract = {Perceiving and synchronizing to a piece of dance is a remarkable skill in humans. Research in this area is very recent and has been focused mainly on entrainment produced by regular rhythms. Here, we investigated entrainment effects on spectators perceiving a non-rhythmic and extremely slow performance issued from contemporary dance. More specifically, we studied the relationship between subjective experience and entrainment produced by perceiving this type of performance. We defined two types of entrainment. Physiological entrainment corresponded to cardiovascular and respiratory coordinated activities. Cognitive entrainment was evaluated through cognitive tasks that quantified time distortion. These effects were thought to reflect attunement of a participant' internal temporal clock to the particularly slow pace of the danced movement. Each participant' subjective experience—in the form of responses to questionnaires—were collected and correlated with cognitive and physiological entrainment. We observe: (a) a positive relationship between psychological entrainment and attention to breathing (their own one or that of dancers); and (b) a positive relationship between cognitive entrainment (reflected as an under-estimation of time following the performance) and attention to their own breathing, and attention to the muscles' dancers. Overall, our results suggest a close relationship between attention to breathing and entrainment. This proof-of-concept pilot study was intended to prove the feasibility of a quantitative situated paradigm. This research is inscribed in a large-scale interdisciplinary project of dance spectating (labodanse.org).},

Four important results were obtained. First, as in the general knowledge domain, subjects were underconfident when judgments were easy and overconfident when they were difficult. Second, paralleling the clear dependence of calibration on decisional difficulty, resolution decreased with increases in decision difficulty arising either from decreases in discriminability or from increasing demands for speed at the expense of accuracy. Third, providing trial-by-trial response feedback on difficult tasks improved resolution but had no effect on calibration. Fourth, subjects can accurately report subjective errors (i.e., trials in which they have indicated that they made an error) with their confidence ratings. It is also shown that the properties of decision time, conditionalized on confidence category, impose a rigorous set of constraints on theories of confidence calibration.},

We base our review on the social shaping of the human mind and discuss various aspects of brain function related to social interaction. Despite private mental contents, people can share their understanding of the world using, beyond verbal communication, nonverbal cues such as gestures, facial expressions, and postures. The understanding of nonverbal messages is supported by the brain's mirroring systems that are shaped by individual experience. Within the organism-environment system, tight links exist between action and perception, both within an individual and between several individuals. Therefore, any comprehensive brain imaging study of the neuronal basis of social cognition requires appreciation of the situated and embodied nature of human cognition, motivating simultaneous monitoring of brain and bodily functions within a socially relevant environment. Because single-person studies alone cannot unravel the dynamic aspects of interpersonal interactions, it seems both necessary and beneficial to move towards "two-person neuroscience"; technological shortcomings and a limited conceptual framework have so far hampered such a leap. We conclude by discussing some major disorders of social interaction.},

Every successive stride is slightly different and the magnitude of stride variation has traditionally been used to identify gait control dysfunction. Over the past two decades, however, the manner in which gait variability is quantified, and ultimately interpreted, has experienced a paradigm shift as researchers have begun to exploit a theoretical framework based on nonlinear dynamics. This has expanded the focus beyond traditional metrics and toward an examination of stride variability dynamics, and has led to further insight into how humans adapt their gait to prevent slips and trips, and avoid collisions. This chapter first examines the variable nature of gait, how constraints influence gait variability, and expounds upon the theoretical framework of dynamical disease. Next, four classes of commonly used computational methods within the gait variability literature are discussed. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the implications this approach has for theoretical and clinical research, as well as what such a framework affords researchers in the future.},

(1995). Sustained attention training for unilateral neglect: Theoretical and rehabilitation implications. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 17, 416-430] with an autonomic arousal biofeedback protocol in which participants learn to modulate their own arousal levels. The SAT protocol was first validated with a group of 23 neurologically healthy participants and then independently tested in a group of 18 adults with ADHD to determine its clinical utility. Half of the participants in each group were assigned to a placebo condition to control for non-specific effects. All participants performed the sustained attention to response task (SART) during pre- and post-training testing sessions to assess training effects on sustained attention. By the end of SAT all participants were able to modulate their own arousal levels without external prompting. Comparison of pre- and post-training baseline data indicated that, as predicted, SAT was associated with increased levels of autonomic arousal accompanied by improved accuracy on the SART. In contrast, participants in the placebo condition exhibited a gradual reduction in arousal over time and increased reaction time variability indicative of a vigilance decrement. These data demonstrate that the recruitment of top-down control processes during volitional modulation of arousal leads to improved sustained attention. These findings have important implications for the rehabilitation of attention deficits arising from frontal dysfunction. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We found that the ANS signals were temporally aligned across individuals, indicating a reliable stimulus-driven response. The degree of response reliability was associated with the emotional time line of the movie. Finally, individual differences in ANS response reliability were strongly correlated with the subjective emotional responses.

The present study tests two hypotheses: (1) Between-person differences in resting RSA are related to emotional reactivity, and (2) within-person changes in RSA are related to regulatory efforts. Pairs of women watched an upsetting film and discussed it. One woman in each of the experimental dyads was asked to either suppress or to reappraise during the conversation. Their partners and both members of the control dyads conversed naturally. Between-person differences in resting RSA were assessed with paced breathing, and within-person changes in RSA were calculated from baseline to the conversation accounting for respiration.

abstract = {Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a commonly employed non-invasive measure of cardiac vagal control. It has been demonstrated that respiratory parameters such as tidal volume and respiratory fre-quency can change RSA without altering tonic vagal activity. Thus, within-individual comparisons of cardiac vagal control across different behavioral tasks might benefit from an adjustment for respiratory confounds. We tested an adjustment method using transfer function analysis and paced breathing at 3 different respiratory frequencies as the basis for regressing out respiratory related RSA changes in a task where breathing was not controlled. Electrocardiogram and calibrated respiration were recorded with the LifeShirt system from 15 young adult participants. Time series of RR intervals and lung volume change were computed and the respiration-to-RR-interval transfer-function magnitude (RSA-TF, in ms/liter) estimated. Mean (SD) of RSA-TF was 142 (68) at 9 breaths/min, 78 (52) at 13.5 breaths/min, 57 (43) at 18 breaths/min, and 121 (56) during baseline, with a respiratory frequency of 12.5 (3.8) breaths/min. At baseline, measured and predicted RSA-TF values (mean 94+/-82) differed significantly and correlated only moderately (r=0.67). Factors contributing to a less than perfect correlation included slightly ele-vated subjective anxiety levels and hyperventilation during paced breathing, both of which may have affected cardiac vagal tone. This study demonstrates a novel procedure for computing a respiratory unre-lated RSA index. Results provide some support for the utility of this adjustment method for improving the estimation of cardiac vagal tone from RSA, but also indicate that the paced breathing procedure may need to be further refined.},

abstract = {A fundamental observation in the social and behavioral sciences is that people change over time, but not necessarily in the same way or at the same rate. For example, verbal ability increases steadily throughout the elemen-tary school years, but it does not increase at the same rate for all students. There are individual differences in the rate and direction of change in many contexts, and these individual differences in change are often of scientific or practical interest. Change over time can be measured in seconds, as in studies of cardiac reactivity, or in decades, as in life span development stud-ies. Marital arguments, for example, may cause significant endocrinologi-cal change over the course of only a few minutes, but these changes can be quite different for husbands than for wives (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1997). Flora and Chassin (2005) examined growth in drug use among adolescents as a function of parent alcoholism, following participants over a number of years through young adulthood. Early approaches to investigating change were very limited in that (a) they focused exclusively either on group-level or on individual-level growth and (b) they addressed only two occasions of measurement, resulting in data too impoverished to allow examination of some of the most basic and interesting hypotheses about change over time. 1 01-Preacher-45609:01-Preacher-45609.qxd 6/3/2008 3:36 PM Page 1 More extensive data and more advanced statistical methods are often needed to enable scientists to discern and understand not only the shape and direction of change (trajectory) but also to identify the sources and conse-quences of change. Longitudinal designs can yield valuable information about trends in psychological phenomena as well as individual differences in aspects of change over time. The richness of such data increases with the number of waves of data collection. Willett (1989) and Willett and Sayer (1994) dis-cuss several advantages associated with longitudinal data drawn from mul-tiple waves of data collection, relative to two-wave data: (a) the quality of research findings will be enhanced, (b) psychological theories may suggest appropriate functional forms for growth, (c) it is possible to test hypotheses about systematic interindividual differences in growth, (d) it is possible to associate features of growth with background characteristics, and (e) preci-sion and reliability in growth measurement is a rapid monotonic increasing function of the number of waves. In short, longitudinal data not only enhance the statistical power of hypothesis tests but also enable researchers to test hypotheses they would be unable to address with cross-sectional or two-wave data. Although many techniques have been developed to capitalize on these desirable features of longitudinal data, the focus of this book is on latent growth curve modeling (LGM). LGM represents a broad class of statistical methods that permit better hypothesis articulation, provide enhanced statis-tical power, and allow greater correspondence between the statistical model and the theory under investigation relative to competing methods. LGM permits straightforward examination of intraindividual (within-person) change over time as well as interindividual (between-person) variability in intraindividual change. LGM is appealing not only because of its ability to model change but also because it allows investigation into the antecedents and consequents of change. A selection of the kinds of questions the LGM framework can enable sci-entists to articulate and test include the following: • What is the shape of the mean trend over time? • Does the initial level predict rate of change? • Do two or more groups differ in their trajectories? • Does rate of change or degree of curvature in the mean trend predict},

Sometimes, we become aware of our body signals and use them in planning and strategic thinking. Here, we show behavioral and neural dissociations between learning to follow one's own heartbeat and metacognitive awareness of one's performance, in a heartbeat-tapping task performed before and after auditory feedback. The electroencephalography amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potential in interoceptive learners, that is, participants whose accuracy of tapping to their heartbeat improved after auditory feedback, was higher compared with non-learners. However, an increase in gamma phase synchrony (30-45 Hz) after the heartbeat auditory feedback was present only in those participants showing agreement between objective interoceptive performance and metacognitive awareness. Source localization in a group of participants and direct cortical recordings in a single patient identified a network hub for interoceptive learning in the insular cortex. In summary, interoceptive learning may be mediated by the right insular response to the heartbeat, whereas metacognitive awareness of learning may be mediated by widespread cortical synchronization patterns.},

Furthermore, recent biological studies demonstrate that the physiological signals of interacting individuals become coupled as well, exhibiting temporally synchronized response patterns. However, it is yet unknown whether people can shape each other's responses without the direct, face-to-face interaction. Here we investigated whether the convergence of physiological and emotional states can occur among "merely co-present" individuals, without direct interactional exchanges. To this end, we measured continuous autonomic signals and collected emotional responses of participants who watched emotional movies together, seated side-by-side. We found that the autonomic signals of co-present participants were idiosyncratically synchronized and that the degree of this synchronization was correlated with the convergence of their emotional responses. These findings suggest that moment-to-moment emotional transmissions, resulting in shared emotional experiences, can occur in the absence of direct communication and are mediated by autonomic synchronization.},

abstract = {Recent advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the understanding of heart–brain interaction and communication. Cardiac information to the brain relies on two pathways, terminating in the insular cortex (IC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), along with the somatosensory cortex (S1-S2). Interoception relying on these neuroanatomical pathways has been shown to modulate social cognition. We report the case study of C.S., a patient with an external heart (an extracorporeal left-univentricular cardiac assist device, LVAD). The patient was assessed with neural/behavioral measures of cardiac interoception complemented by neuropsychological and social cognition measures. The patients performance on the interoception task (heartbeat detection) seemed to be guided by signals from the artificial LVAD, which provides a somatosensory beat rather than by his endogenous heart. Cortical activity (HEP, heartbeat-evoked potential) was found decreased in comparison with normal volunteers, particularly during interoceptive states. The patient accurately performed several cognitive tasks, except for interoception-related social cognition domains (empathy, theory of mind and decision making). This evidence suggests an imbalance in the patients cardiac interoceptive pathways that enhances sensation driven by the artificial pump over that from the cardiac vagal-IC/ACC pathway. A patient with two hearts, one endogenous and one artificial, presents a unique opportunity to explore models of interoception and heart–brain interaction. INTRODUCTION Interoception, the processing of bodily signals from the viscera and somatic tissues, has been recently proposed as a core aspect of motiv-ational regulation of behavior and cognition (Craig, 2002; Bechara and Naqvi, 2004; Singer et al., 2009). A systematic method for assessing interoception is to measure performance on heartbeat detection (HBD) tasks (Cameron, 2002; Craig, 2002). HBD capability has been shown to correlate with affective and cognitive psychological states (Domschke et al., 2010) as well as cardio-dynamic parameters, such as stroke volume and momentum of the ejected blood mass (Schandry et al., 1993). Furthermore, it has been found that HBD is also associated with neurophysiological measures. A heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) was initially described in scalp electroencephalography (EEG) (Schandry and Weitkunat, 1990). Further evidence showed that it was generated by the insular cortex (IC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Pollatos et al., 2005), which are considered key nodes for interocep-tion (Craig, 2003; Critchley et al., 2004). Meanwhile, current interoception research suggests different neural pathways mediating body awareness: (i) visceral afferents projecting to the IC and ACC; (ii) skin afferents projecting to secondary somato-sensory cortex (S2) or (iii) both of them. The first pathway comprises vagal fibers endings in low-threshold mechano-receptors in the atria, ventroatrial and ventricles (Malliani et al., 1986; Longhurst, 2004), which project to the main homeostatic integration sites in the brain-stem. There, they converge with the lamina-1 spinothalamocortical pathway that conveys homeostatic information from other tissues and finally to IC–ACC (Craig, 2002). Functional neuroimaging studies of normal subjects while performing HBD tasks have evidenced that interoceptive accuracy and sensitivity is related to activations of IC (specifically right anterior IC) (Critchley et al., 2004; Pollatos et al., 2007b). However, these same studies additionally reported S2 activa-tion related to cardiac interoception (the second pathway), which sug-gests that skin afferent projections might also be involved in heartbeat interoception. Further functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research with pharmacologically enhanced interoception (Cameron and Minoshima, 2002) and source EEG estimation, found activation of IC, ACC and S2 (Pollatos et al., 2007a). Moreover, subjects located their perceived heartbeat sensations mostly in the lower left chest, the neck, belly and head, locations close to major arteries' trajectories (Khalsa et al., 2009b). These results converge with the fact that individuals with lower body mass index are better HBD performers (Rouse et al., 1988), suggesting that receptors in the skin might play a role in the cardiac interoceptive awareness. Furthermore, a lesion study provided results that both pathways of cardiac interoception independently mediate the heartbeats awareness (Khalsa et al., 2009a). They assessed a patient with bilateral damage to IC–ACC},

We developed a new real-time coordination game that required two individuals of a dyad to synchronize with a partner (coordination task) or with a computer (control task) by counting in mind rhythmically. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded simultaneously from a dyad to examine OT effects on inter-brain synchrony of neural activity during interpersonal coordination. Experiment 1 found that dyads showed smaller interpersonal time lags of counting and greater inter-brain synchrony of alpha-band neural oscillations during the coordination (vs control) task and these effects were reliably observed in female but not male dyads. Moreover, the increased alpha-band inter-brain syn-chrony predicted better interpersonal behavioral synchrony across all participants. Experiment 2, using a double blind, placebo-controlled between-subjects design, revealed that intranasal OT vs placebo administration in male dyads improved interpersonal behavioral synchrony in both the coordination and control tasks but specifically enhanced alpha-band inter-brain neural oscillations during the coordination task. Our findings provide first evidence that OT enhances inter-brain syn-chrony in male adults to facilitate social coordination.},

abstract = {Although respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a commonly quantified physiological variable, the methods for quantification are not consistent. This manuscript questions the assumption that respiration frequency needs to be manipulated or monitored to generate an accurate measure of RSA amplitude. A review of recent papers is presented that contrast RSA amplitude with measures that use respiratory parameters to adjust RSA amplitude. In addition, data from two studies are presented to evaluate empirically both the relation between RSA amplitude and respiration frequency and the covariation between RSA frequency and respiration frequency. The literature review demonstrates similar findings between both classes of measures. The first study demonstrates, during spontaneous breathing without task demands, that there is no relation between respiration frequency and RSA amplitude and that respiration frequency can be accurately derived from the heart period spectrum (i.e., frequency of RSA). The second study demonstrates that respiration frequency is unaffected by atropine dose, a manipulation that systematically mediates the amplitude of RSA, and that the tight linkage between the RSA frequency and respiration frequency is unaffected by atropine. The research shows that the amplitude of RSA is not affected by respiration frequency under either baseline conditions or vagal manipulation via atropine injection. Respiration frequency is therefore unlikely to be a concern under these conditions. Research examining conditions that produce (causal) deviations from the intrinsic relation between respiratory parameters and the amplitude of RSA combined with appropriate statistical procedures for understanding these deviations are necessary. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Many studies have shown a consistent pattern in adults' responses to affective pictures and there is growing evidence of gender differences, as well. Little is known, though, about children's verbal, behavioral, and physiological responses to affective pictures. Two experiments investigated children's responses to pictures. In Experiment 1, children, adolescents, and adults viewed pictures varying in affective content and rated them for pleasure, arousal, and dominance. Results indicated that children and adolescents rated the pictures similarly to adults. In Experiment 2, physiological responses, self-report, and viewing time were measured while children viewed affective pictures. As with adults, children's responses reflected the affective content of the pictures. Gender differences in affective evaluations, corrugator activity, skin conductance, startle modulation, and viewing time indicated that girls were generally more reactive to unpleasant materials.},

@article{Friston2005b,
abstract = {This article concerns the nature of evoked brain responses and the principles underlying their generation. We start with the premise that the sensory brain has evolved to represent or infer the causes of changes in its sensory inputs. The problem of inference is well formulated in statistical terms. The statistical fundaments of inference may therefore afford important constraints on neuronal implementation. By formulating the original ideas of Helmholtz on perception, in terms of modern-day statistical theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts.It turns out that the problems of inferring the causes of sensory input (perceptual inference) and learning the relationship between input and cause (perceptual learning) can be resolved using exactly the same principle. Specifically, both inference and learning rest on minimizing the brain's free energy, as defined in statistical physics. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. Cortical responses can be seen as the brain's attempt to minimize the free energy induced by a stimulus and thereby encode the most likely cause of that stimulus. Similarly, learning emerges from changes in synaptic efficacy that minimize the free energy, averaged over all stimuli encountered. The underlying scheme rests on empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of cortical organization and responses. The aim of this article is to encompass many apparently unrelated anatomical, physiological and psychophysical attributes of the brain within a single theoretical perspective. In terms of cortical architectures, the theoretical treatment predicts that sensory cortex should be arranged hierarchically, that connections should be reciprocal and that forward and backward connections should show a functional asymmetry (forward connections are driving, whereas backward connections are both driving and modulatory). In terms of synaptic physiology, it predicts associative plasticity and, for dynamic models, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. In terms of electrophysiology, it accounts for classical and extra classical receptive field effects and long-latency or endogenous components of evoked cortical responses. It predicts the attenuation of responses encoding prediction error with perceptual learning and explains many phenomena such as repetition suppression, mismatch negativity (MMN) and the P300 in electroencephalography. In psychophysical terms, it accounts for the behavioural correlates of these physiological phenomena, for example, priming and global precedence. The final focus of this article is on perceptual learning as measured with the MMN and the implications for empirical studies of coupling among cortical areas using evoked sensory responses.},

Questions about the neural bases of emotion regulation have recently taken on new import-ance, as functional imaging studies in humans have permitted direct investigation of control strategies that draw upon higher cognitive processes difficult to study in nonhumans. Such studies have examined (1) control-ling attention to, and (2) cognitively changing the meaning of, emotionally evocative stimuli. These two forms of emotion regulation depend upon interactions between prefrontal and cingulate control systems and cortical and subcortical emotion-generative systems. Taken together, the results suggest a functional archi-tecture for the cognitive control of emotion that dove-tails with findings from other human and nonhuman research on emotion.},

abstract = {The pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa (AN) is not completely understood, but research suggests that alterations in brain circuits related to cognitive control and emotion are central. The aim of this study was to explore neural responses to an emotional conflict task in women recovered from AN. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure neural responses to an emotional conflict task in 22 women recovered from AN and 21 age-matched healthy controls. The task involved categorizing affective faces while ignoring affective words. Face and word stimuli were either congruent (non-conflict) or incongruent (conflict). Brain responses to emotional conflict did not differ between groups. However, in response to emotional non-conflict, women recovered from AN relative to healthy controls showed significantly less activation in the bilateral amygdala. Specifically, while emotional non-conflict evoked significant activations of the amygdala in healthy controls, recovered AN women did not show such activations. Similar significant group differences were also observed in the hippocampus and basal ganglia. These results suggest that women recovered from AN are characterized by alterations within emotion-related brain circuits. Recovered women's absence of amygdala and hippocampus activation during non-conflict trials possibly reflects an impaired ability to process emotional significant stimuli.},

abstract = {FMRI studies of response inhibition consistently reveal frontal lobe activation. Localization within the frontal cortex, however, varies across studies and appears dependent on the nature of the task. Activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis is a powerful quantitative method of establishing concurrence of activation across functional neuroimaging studies. For this study, ALE was used to investigate concurrent neural correlates of successfully inhibited No-go stimuli across studies of healthy adults performing a Go/No-go task, a paradigm frequently used to measure response inhibition. Due to the potential overlap of neural circuits for response selection and response inhibition, the analysis included only event-related studies contrasting No-go activation with baseline, which allowed for inclusion of all regions that may be critical to visually-guided motor response inhibition, including those involved in response selection. These Go/No-go studies were then divided into two groups: " simple " Go/No-go tasks in which the No-go stimulus was always the same, and " complex " Go/No-go tasks, in which the No-go stimulus changed depending on context, requiring frequent updating of stimulus-response associations in working memory. The simple and complex tasks demonstrated distinct patterns of concurrence, with right dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal circuits recruited under conditions of increased working memory demand. Common to both simple and complex Go/No-go tasks was concurrence in the pre-SMA and the left fusiform gyrus. As the pre-SMA has also been shown to be involved in response selection, the results support the notion that the pre-SMA is critical for selection of appropriate behavior, whether selecting to execute an appropriate response or selecting to inhibit an inappropriate response.},

The present study investigated whether commonly used neuropsychological test measures of EF (i.e., working memory, Stroop, trail making, and verbal fluency) were related to ability to downregulate emotion both spontaneously and when instructed to suppress emotional expressions. To ensure a wide range of EF, 24 frontotemporal lobar degeneration patients, 7 Alzheimer's patients, and 17 neurologically normal controls participated. Participants were exposed to an acoustic startle stimulus (single aversive noise burst) under three conditions: (1) unwarned, (2) warned with no instructions (to measure spontaneous emotion downregulation), and (3) warned with instructions to suppress (to measure instructed emotion downregulation). Results indicated that higher verbal fluency scores were related to greater emotion regulation (operationalized as reduction in body movement and emotional facial behavior when warned of the impending startle) in both regulation conditions. No relationships were found between emotion regulation in these conditions and the other EF measures. We conclude that, of four commonly used measures of EF, verbal fluency best indexes the complex processes of monitoring, evaluation, and control necessary for successful emotion regulation, both spontaneously and following instructions to suppress.},

abstract = {Emotions seem to come and go as they please. However, we actually hold considerable sway over our emotions: We influence which emotions we have and how we experience and express these emotions. The process model of emotion regulation described here suggests that how we regulate our emotions matters. Regulatory strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have quite different outcomes than strategies that act later. This review focuses on two widely used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It involves inhibiting the outward signs of emotion. Theory and research suggest that reappraisal is more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases the experience and behavioral expression of emotion, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease the experience of emotion, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding in both the suppressors and their social partners.},

The program was administered to 72 preterms, while 74 preterms and 75 full-terms formed control groups (N = 221). Behavior was reported by parents (Child Behavior Checklist) and teachers (Teachers Report Form) and by all on selected Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) questions. Long-term behavioral development appeared to be qualitatively unaffected by the intervention. At ages 7 and 9, fewer attention problems and better adaptation to school were reported from parents and teachers of the intervention group compared to preterm controls. At age 9, teachers reported fewer difficulties in the intervention group and better academic performance. In these areas they were reported as being at the statistically same level as term controls.},

abstract = {Body-awareness relies on the representation of both interoceptive and exteroceptive percepts coming from one's body. However, the exact relationship and possible interaction of interoceptive and exteroceptive systems for body-awareness remain unknown. We sought to understand for the first time, to our knowledge, the interaction between interoceptive and exteroceptive awareness of the body. First, we measured interoceptive awareness with an established heartbeat monitoring task. We, then, used a multi-sensory-induced manipulation of body-ownership (e.g. Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI)) and we quantified the extent to which participants experienced ownership over a foreign body-part using behavioural, physiological and introspective measures. The results suggest that interoceptive sensitivity predicts the malleability of body representations, that is, people with low interoceptive sensitivity experienced a stronger illusion of ownership in the RHI. Importantly, this effect was not simply owing to a poor proprioceptive representation or differences in autonomic states of one's body prior to the multi-sensory stimulation, suggesting that interoceptive awareness modulates the online integration of multi-sensory body-percepts.},

Good (n = 20) and poor (n = 20) perceivers of cardiac activity were selected on the basis of their performance according to Whitehead et al. (1977) heartbeat discrimination procedure. Measures of state and trait anxiety (the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form X-1 and Form X-2) and Tellegen's Absorption Scale (TAS) were used to assess emotionality and absorptive ability. Good and poor heartbeat perceivers (a) were given non-motivating instructions to try to either increase or decrease their heart rate (HR) with, or (b) without the use of HR-feedback, and (c) were given motivating instructions to try to either increase or decrease their HR with, or (d) without HR-feedback. Heart rate, skin conductance (SC), and EMG activity were monitored. Subjects were also requested to indicate the cognitive strategies used during their HR control training. No relationship between heartbeat perception and state-trait anxiety measures was found. The results did not support the idea that individual differences in heartbeat perception are related to individual differences in HR-control. They did indicate, however, that motivating instructions improve the capacity to increase or decrease HR. Subjects were able to voluntarily increase or decrease their HRs with or without a feedback signal. However, more pronounced HR increases were obtained in the feedback as compared with the no-feedback condition. SC and EMG activity were in accordance with arousal levels demanded by HR decrease and increase tasks. Subjects used cognitive strategies concerning activation responses during HR-increase and relaxation responses during HR-decrease conditions. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Eyewitness identification is a pivotal issue in applied research because, in practice, a correct identification can help to remove a dangerous criminal from society, but a false identification can lead to the erroneous conviction of an innocent suspect. Consequently, psychologists have tried to ascertain the best procedures for collecting identification evidence, evaluating them using measures based on the ratio of correct to false identification rates. Unfortunately, ratio-based measures are ambiguous because they change systematically as a function of a witness's willingness to choose. In other words, a measure thought to index discriminability is instead fully confounded with response bias. A better method involves constructing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Using ROC curves, researchers can trace out discriminability across levels of response bias for each procedure. We illustrate the shortcomings of ratio-based measures and demonstrate why ROC analysis is required. In recent studies, researchers comparing simultaneous and sequential lineup procedures using ROC analyses have provided no evidence for the sequential superiority effect and instead have shown that the simultaneous procedure may be diagnostically superior. It is not yet clear which lineup procedure will prove to be generally superior, but it is clear that ROC analysis is the only way to make that determination.},

abstract = {Although there has been much support for HRV Biofeedback as an effective intervention for various disorders, there is a lack of comprehension of the underlying mechanisms. The predominant theories of increased vagal efferents and baroreflex gain are insufficient in explaining the frequent observations that HRV Biofeedback impacts changes in constructs beyond ANS mediation, such as emotion regulation, attentional control, and self-regulatory reserve. It has been suspected that vagal afferent functioning may be the underlying mechanism, but little research has explored this. Previously, researchers measured cortical evoked potentials contingent to the heart, or an indication of vagal afferent functioning (Schandry et al., 1986). Twenty-five participants were randomly stratified to HRV Biofeedback or EMG Biofeedback for four sessions. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that the HRV group exhibited statistically significantly increased baseline Heartbeat Event-Related Potentials (updated term for ‘evoked potential') while the relaxation control group did not. The results of this study provide initial support to the premise that HRV Biofeedback stimulates changes in the vagal afferent pathway that are longer lasting than simply the short term effects of breathing.},

@article{Critchley2012,
abstract = {A goal of cognitive neuroscience is to understand how the con-scious mind is produced by, and influences, biological processes (Rees {\&} Seth, 2010). Scientists and clinicians typically hold that subjective mental experience, thoughts, and feelings are hosted by the brain through its intrinsic neural activity. Other bodily organs, while under the brain's control, are not generally considered to have this relationship to consciousness. This dis-tinction can therefore be exploited as a model for characterizing the physical correlates of mind through tracking neurally mediated interaction between changes in body (outside the brain) and changes in emotion and cognition. Body–mind interactions are of particular interest to understanding emotions and motivations. Bodily states shape mental content: If we are dehydrated we experience thirst, if nutritionally deprived, hun-ger. These basic motivational changes influence how we inter-act mentally and physically with our environment. Motivational changes are elicited by other external threats to the physiologi-cal integrity and by external stimuli that may ensure the body's integrity. Changes in the physiological state of the body accompany the processing of such aversive and appetitive motivational cues to facilitate and anticipate appropriate behaviours. Thus, stimuli with potentially negative or positive consequences become " emotionally-competent " (Damasio, 2001) and divert physiological resources to meet evolutionary imperatives (Panksepp, 1998). Arguably, if a stimulus elicits no change in bodily physiology then it cannot be viewed as emotive. Action programmes (stereotypical changes in bodily physiology) are evoked automatically by strongly salient stim-uli without the initial need for cognitive appraisal. James (1994) and Lange (1885) proposed that the emotion follows the physi-ological response and is the feeling of that response. James used a number of analogies to describe what he meant by emotion; for example, proposing that the absence of this bodily response would result in a perception being " pale, colorless, destitute of emotional warmth. " Walter Cannon challenged this view by arguing that the same emotion can occur in different bodily states, and that the differentiation of physiological arousal was too coarse to account for the richness of emotional experience (Cannon, 1927). A partial resolution was proposed by Schachter and Singer (1962), who argued that changes in the body can initiate and intensify emotions but must be interpreted cogni-tively to determine which emotion is experienced.

Interoceptive signaling has been considered a component process of reflexes, urges, feelings, drives, adaptive responses, cognitive and emotional experiences, highlighting its contributions to the maintenance of homeostatic functioning, body regulation, and survival. Dysfunction of interoception is increasingly recognized as an important component of different mental health conditions including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, eating disorders, addictive disorders, somatic symptom disorders, and others. However, a number of conceptual and methodological challenges have made it difficult for interoceptive constructs to be broadly applied in mental health research and treatment settings. In November 2016, the Laureate Institute for Brain Research organized the first Interoception Summit, a gathering of interoception experts from around the world, with the goal of accelerating progress in understanding the role of interoception in mental health.

abstract = {This study tests the hypothesis that high levels of high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) predisposes individuals to affiliate with new groups. Resting cardiac physiological recordings were taken before and after experimental sessions to measure trait high-frequency heart rate variability as an index of dispositional autonomic influence on heart rate. Following an experimental manipulation of priming of caring-related words, participants engaged in a minimal group paradigm, in which they imagined being a member of one of two arbitrary groups, allocated money to members of the two groups, and rated their affiliation with the groups. High levels of HF-HRV were associated with ingroup favouritism while allocating money, an effect largely attributable to a positive relationship between HF-HRV and allocation of money to the ingroup, and less due to a negative relationship between HF-HRV and money allocation to the outgroup. HF-HRV was also associated with increased self-reported affiliation feelings for the ingroup but was unrelated to feelings towards the outgroup. These effects remained substantial even after controlling for age, gender, BMI, mood, caffeine consumption, time of day of data collection, smoking and alcohol behaviour, and respiration rate. Further, the effects were observed regardless of whether participants were primed with caring-related words or not. This study is the first to bridge a long history of research on ingroup favouritism to the relatively recent body of research on cardiac vagal tone by uncovering a positive association between HF-HRV and affiliation with a novel group.},

abstract = {Lately, growing attention in the health sciences has been paid to the dynamics of heart rate as indicator of impending failures and for prognoses. Likewise, in social and cognitive sciences, heart rate is increasingly employed as a measure of arousal, emotional engagement and as a marker of interpersonal coordination. However, there is no consensus about which measurements and analytical tools are most appropriate in mapping the temporal dynamics of heart rate and quite different metrics are reported in the literature. As complexity metrics of heart rate variability depend critically on variability of the data, different choices regarding the kind of measures can have a substantial impact on the results. In this article we compare linear and non-linear statistics on two prominent types of heart beat data, beat-to-beat intervals (R-R interval) and beats-per-min (BPM). As a proof-of-concept, we employ a simple rest-exercise-rest task and show that non-linear statistics-fractal (DFA) and recurrence (RQA) analyses-reveal information about heart beat activity above and beyond the simple level of heart rate. Non-linear statistics unveil sustained post-exercise effects on heart rate dynamics, but their power to do so critically depends on the type data that is employed: While R-R intervals are very susceptible to non-linear analyses, the success of non-linear methods for BPM data critically depends on their construction. Generally, "oversampled" BPM time-series can be recommended as they retain most of the information about non-linear aspects of heart beat dynamics.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, assessment of heart rate variability (HRV) has increased in various fields of research. HRV describes changes in heartbeat intervals, which are caused by autonomic neural regulation, i.e. by the interplay of the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. The most frequent application of HRV is connected to cardiological issues, most importantly to the monitoring of post-myocardial infarction patients and the prediction of sudden cardiac death. Analysis of HRV is also frequently applied in relation to diabetes, renal failure, neurological and psychiatric conditions, sleep disorders, psychological phenomena such as stress, as well as drug and addiction research including alcohol and smoking. The widespread application of HRV measurements is based on the fact that they are noninvasive, easy to perform, and in general reproducible – if carried out under standardized conditions. However, the amount of parameters to be analysed is still rising. Well-established time domain and frequency domain parameters are discussed controversially when it comes to their physiological interpretation and their psychometric properties like reliability and validity, and the sensitivity to cardiovascular properties of the variety of parameters seems to be a topic for further research. Recently introduced parameters like pNNxx and new dynamic methods such as approximate entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis offer new potentials and warrant standardization. However, HRV is significantly associated with average heart rate (HR) and one can conclude that HRV actually provides information on two quantities, i.e. on HR and its variability. It is hard to determine which of these two plays a principal role in the clinical value of HRV. The association between HRV and HR is not only a physiological phenomenon but also a mathematical one which is due to non-linear (mathematical) relationship between RR interval and HR. If one normalizes HRV to its average RR interval, one may get ‘pure' variability free from the mathematical bias. Recently, a new modification method of the association between HRV and HR has been developed which enables us to completely remove the HRV dependence on HR (even the physiological one), or conversely enhance this dependence. Such an approach allows us to explore the HR contribution to the clinical significance of HRV, i.e. whether HR or its variability plays a main role in the HRV clinical value. This Research Topic covers recent advances in the application of HRV, methodological issues, basic underlying mechanisms as well as all aspects of the interaction between HRV and HR.},

abstract = {Researchers have demonstrated that individuals can successfully reduce their heart rate (HR) response to a stressor when provided with heart rate feedback. However, it is unclear whether individuals can transfer HR reduction skills to stressors not used during HR feedback training. The present study used a multiple baseline, single subject design to examine the transfer of HR feedback training among six individuals. Participants were provided with HR feedback training during the presentation of a videogame, a mental arithmetic challenge, and a hand grip task until the participants reduced their HR to within 4 bpm of their resting HR or until they completed three 2-hour training sessions. The participants' ability to reduce HR responses to the three training tasks with no HR feedback was assessed during an immediate post-training period, which followed training on each task. The participants' ability to reduce HR responses to the training tasks and a speech task was assessed during short delay (i.e., 1-2 days) and long delay (1-2 weeks) post-training sessions. Overall, participants demonstrated that during HR feedback training, they could successfully reduce their HR and generally could maintain this reduction in HR to the training task during an immediate post-training assessment when HR was not present. However, individuals were not able to reduce their HR responses to tasks during the short delay and long delay post-training sessions and they were unable to transfer HR reduction skills to a novel task (i.e., the speech task). In general, blood pressure responses to the tasks during the post-training sessions were equivalent to pre-training blood pressure levels. Individuals demonstrated consistent performance levels during the videogame and hand grip tasks, and increasing performance levels during the mental arithmetic task. Additional research is needed to examine whether providing motivation (e.g., monetary rewards) during post-training sessions or teaching specific HR reducing skills (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing) might enhance the transfer of HR feedback training and the reduction of HR responses to any number of tasks. iii Acknowledgements},

abstract = {The present study evaluated multiple system physiological responding which accompanied EMG biofeedback performance under two conditions{\^{a}}€”during EMG biofeedback training sessions, and during the utilization of that training in the presence of a stressor. Twelve subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) an EMG biofeedback group, or 2) a false-EMG biofeedback group. During the training sessions, significant frontalis EMG decreases were produced by the biofeedback group. This performance was associated with a concomitant decrease in heart rate and respiration rate, but an increase in skin conductance level. The biofeedback group was also able to maintain a low level of EMG activity during a stress-induction procedure. However, this low level of activity did not generalize to other physiological responses. Heart rate and skin conductance levels both increased, which coincided with the subjects' self-report of anxiety during this phase of the study. These data clearly demonstrate that single-system arousal reduction produced by EMG biofeedback training, rather than producing cross-system arousal reduction, produces specificity of a single response change under a stress-inducing situation..

abstract = {Emotions have been proposed to inform risky decision-making through the influence of affective physiological responses on subjective value. The ability to perceive internal body states, or "interoception" may influence this relationship. Here, we examined whether interoception predicts participants' degree of loss aversion, which has been previously linked to choice-related arousal responses. Participants performed both a heartbeat-detection task indexing interoception and a risky monetary decision-making task, from which loss aversion, risk attitudes and choice consistency were parametrically measured. Interoceptive ability correlated selectively with loss aversion and was unrelated to the other value parameters. This finding suggests that specific and separable component processes underlying valuation are shaped not only by our physiological responses, as shown in previous findings, but also by our interoceptive access to such signals.},

abstract = {Electrodermal activity reflects autonomic sympathetic innervation of dermal sweat glands providing an index of emotion-related bodily states of arousal. Relaxation techniques, which are facilitated by external (bio)feedback of electrodermal activity, can be used by trained subjects to actively control bodily and emotional arousal. Biofeedback relaxation provides an experimental model to explore neural mechanisms contributing to emotional representations and intentional autonomic control. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore neural mechanisms contributing to integration of volitional intent, self-representation, and autonomic states of arousal, embodied within performance of a biofeedback relaxation exercise. Data were obtained from 17 subjects to assess brain activity during relaxation in which a visual index of electrodermal arousal was modulated by accuracy (addition of random “noise”) or sensitivity (by scalar adjustments of feedback). A central matrix of cortical, subcortical and brainstem autonomic centres was activated during biofeedback relaxation, as well as regions that mediate visual and somatesthetic representations and executive control. Anterior cingulate, amygdala, and insula activity was modulated by task manipulations that increased demand on processing interoceptive representations, while variation in anterior insula activity reflected an interaction between accuracy and sensitivity of feedback. These findings identify neural substrates that support integration of perceptual processing, interoception, and intentional modulation of bodily states of arousal.},

This presents a dilemma: Is it better to let emotions go or to pay the price of exerting costly control? In two studies, the authors explore whether emotion regulatory processes associated with implicit positive evaluation of emotion regulation might provide the benefits of successful emotion regulation without the costs. In Study 1, the authors introduce a measure of implicit evaluation of emotion regulation (ER-IAT). Study 2 examined whether this measure is associated with actual emotional responses to an anger provocation. It was found that greater ER-IAT scores were associated with lesser anger experience, fewer negative thoughts, lessened self-reported effortful emotion regulation, and an adaptive pattern of cardiovascular responding. These findings suggest that implicit positive evaluation of emotion regulation is associated with successful, automatic, and physiologically adaptive down-regulation of anger.

abstract = {Considerable literature has focused on neural responses evoked by face viewing. We extend that literature and explore the neural correlates of maternal attachment with an fMRI study in which mothers view photographs of their own children. Seven mothers performed a one-back repetition detection task while viewing photographs of their own child, friends of their child, unfamiliar children, and unfamiliar adults. Viewing one's own child versus a familiar child was associated with activation in the amygdala, insula, anterior paracingulate cortex, and posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). Viewing familiar versus unfamiliar children elicited increased activation in regions associated with familiarity in adults. Viewing unfamiliar children versus unfamiliar adults was associated with activation in the fusiform gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, precuneus, and posterior STS. The sight of one's own child versus that of a familiar child activates regions that mediate emotional responses (amygdala, insula) and are associated with theory of mind functions (anterior paracingulate cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus). These activations may reflect the intense attachment, vigilant protectiveness, and empathy that characterize normal maternal attachment. The sight of an unfamiliar child's face compared with that of an unfamiliar adult engages areas associated with attention as well as face perception. ?? 2004 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

Current practice in cognitive psychology is to accept a single model on the basis of only the "raw" AIC values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the observed AIC differences in terms of a continuous measure such as probability. Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham {\&} Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of AIC model comparison procedures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients are sensitive to psychological stressors. These ef-fects may operate through an enhanced responsiveness of the emotional motor system, a network of brain circuits that modulate arousal, viscerosomatic perception, and auto-nomic responses associated with emotional responses, in-cluding anxiety and anger. The aim of this study was to test the primary hypothesis that IBS patients show altered per-ceptual responses to rectal balloon distention during exper-imentally induced psychological stress compared with healthy control subjects. METHODS: A total of 15 IBS patients (nine women and six men) and 14 healthy controls (seven women and seven men) were studied during two laboratory sessions: 1) a mild stress condition (dichotomous listening to two conflicting types of music), and 2) a control condition (relaxing nature sounds). The stress and relaxation auditory stimuli were delivered over a 10-min listening period preceding rectal distentions and during the rectal distentions but not during the disten-tion rating process. Ratings of intensity and unpleasantness of the visceral sensations, subjective emotional responses, heart rate, and neuroendocrine measures (norepinephrine, cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], and prolac-tin) were obtained during the study. RESULTS: IBS patients, but not healthy controls, rated the 45–mm Hg visceral stimulus significantly higher in terms of intensity and unpleasantness during the stress condition compared with the relaxation condition. IBS patients also reported higher ratings of stress, anger, and anxiety during the stress compared with the relaxing condition, whereas controls had smaller and nonsignificant subjective re-sponses. Heart rate measurements, but not other neuroen-docrine stress measures, were increased under the stress condition in both groups. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the hypothesis of al-tered stress-induced modulation of visceral perception in IBS patients. (Am J Gastroenterol 2003;98:135–143.},

abstract = {The James-Lange theory of emotion proposes that automatically generated bodily reactions not only color subjective emotional experience of stimuli, but also necessitate a mechanism by which these bodily reactions are differentially generated to reflect stimulus quality. To examine this putative mechanism, we simultaneously measured brain activity and heart rate to identify regions where neural activity predicted the magnitude of heart rate responses to emotional facial expressions. Using a forewarned reaction time task, we showed that orienting heart rate acceleration to emotional face stimuli was modulated as a function of the emotion depicted. The magnitude of evoked heart rate increase, both across the stimulus set and within each emotion category, was predicted by level of activity within a matrix of interconnected brain regions, including amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate, and brainstem. We suggest that these regions provide a substrate for translating visual perception of emotional facial expression into differential cardiac responses and thereby represent an interface for selective generation of visceral reactions that contribute to the embodied component of emotional reaction. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {PURPOSE
Beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV) is caused by the fluctuating balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. The Poincar{\'{e}} plot has been used to evaluate HRV. In this study, we validate that this new method may qualitatively and quantitatively assess the sympathovagal fluctuation in patients during induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane. 

METHODS
Twenty-eight young patients were allocated for the study. The patients received a tilt test and on the next day they sustained anesthesia induced with inhaled anesthetics. Electrocardiography signals from the patients were relayed to an analogue-digital converter. The Poincar{\'{e}} plot is quantified by measuring SD1, SD2, and SD1/SD2. Power spectral analyses were performed and LF, HF and HF/LF were calculated. 

RESULTS
The LF power and the SD2 of the Poincar{\'{e}} plot increased while subjects were tilt-up from the supine position. Additionally, a significant correlation were found between LF and SD2, HF and SD1 (p {\textless} 0.05), and LF/HF and SD2/SD1 (p {\textless} 0.01). Sevoflurane inhalation for 10 minutes had no effect on heart rate, but diminished LF, total power and SD1, SD2 of the Poincar{\'{e}} plot respectively. However, the LF, SD2 and LF/HF increased; the HF, SD1 and SD1/SD2 ratio decreased after intubation stimulation. 

CONCLUSION
Poincar{\'{e}} plot and power spectral analysis of HRV during tilt test and sevoflurane induction significantly correlate. Poincar{\'{e}} plot analysis is easier and more sensitive at evaluating the sympathovagal balance and observing the beat-to-beat HRV.},

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify whether a continuum existed, and also used to select 50 least-disturbed sites, which were used to define a theoretical watercourse. The density classes of each species were projected on this longitudinal gradient and each species response was characterised by two typological traits: its typological preferendum (tp) and its typological amplitude (ta), thus creating a synthesis of ecological characteristics. In the typological index given in the appendix, the 210 species which form a biological templet are listed in alphabetical order with their tp and ta values.

To date, this perspective has been applied primarily to exteroceptive perception (e.g., vision, audition), and action. Here, I describe a predictive, inferential perspective on interoception: ‘interoceptive inference' conceives of subjective feeling states (emotions) as arising from actively-inferred generative (predictive) models of the causes of interoceptive afferents. The model generalizes ‘appraisal' theories that view emotions as emerging from cognitive evaluations of physiological changes, and it sheds new light on the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie the experience of body ownership and conscious selfhood in health and in neuropsychiatric illness.},

abstract = {Adolescent risk-taking is a public health issue that increases the odds of poor lifetime outcomes. One factor thought to influence adolescents' propensity for risk taking is an enhanced sensitivity to appetitive cues, relative to an immature capacity to exert sufficient cognitive control. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing interactions among ventral striatal, dorsal striatal, and prefrontal cortical regions with varying appetitive load using fMRI scanning. Child, teen, and adult participants performed a go/no-go task with appetitive (happy faces) and neutral cues (calm faces). Impulse control to neutral cues showed linear improvement with age, whereas teens showed a nonlinear reduction in impulse control to appetitive cues. This performance decrement in teens was paralleled by enhanced activity in the ventral striatum. Prefrontal cortical recruitment correlated with overall accuracy and showed a linear response with age for no-go versus go trials. Connectivity analyses identified a ventral frontostriatal circuit including the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal striatum during no-go versus go trials. Examining recruitment developmentally showed that teens had greater between-subject ventral-dorsal striatal coactivation relative to children and adults for happy no-go versus go trials. These findings implicate exaggerated ventral striatal representation of appetitive cues in adolescents relative to an intermediary cognitive control response. Connectivity and coactivity data suggest these systems communicate at the level of the dorsal striatum differentially across development. Biased responding in this system is one possible mechanism underlying heightened risk taking during adolescence.},

abstract = {One contribution of 16 to a theme issue 'Interoception beyond homeostasis: affect, cognition and mental health'. We review a recent shift in conceptions of interoception and its relationship to hierarchical inference in the brain. The notion of interoceptive inference means that bodily states are regulated by autonomic reflexes that are enslaved by descending predictions from deep generative models of our internal and exter-nal milieu. This re-conceptualization illuminates several issues in cognitive and clinical neuroscience with implications for experiences of selfhood and emotion. We first contextualize interoception in terms of active (Bayesian) inference in the brain, highlighting its enactivist (embodied) aspects. We then consider the key role of uncertainty or precision and how this might translate into neuromodulation. We next examine the implications for understanding the functional anatomy of the emotional brain, surveying recent observations on agranular cortex. Finally, we turn to theoretical issues, namely, the role of interoception in shaping a sense of embodied self and feelings. We will draw links between physiological homoeostasis and allostasis, early cybernetic ideas of predictive control and hierarchical generative models in predictive processing. The explanatory scope of interoceptive inference ranges from expla-nations for autism and depression, through to consciousness. We offer a brief survey of these exciting developments. This article is part of the themed issue 'Interoception beyond homeostasis: affect, cognition and mental health'.},

abstract = {Sharing others' emotional states may facilitate understanding their intentions and actions. Here we show that networks of brain areas "tick together" in participants who are viewing similar emotional events in a movie. Participants' brain activity was measured with functional MRI while they watched movies depicting unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant emotions. After scanning, participants watched the movies again and continuously rated their experience of pleasantness-unpleasantness (i.e., valence) and of arousal-calmness. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to derive multisubject voxelwise similarity measures [intersubject correlations (ISCs)] of functional MRI data. Valence and arousal time series were used to predict the moment-to-moment ISCs computed using a 17-s moving average. During movie viewing, participants' brain activity was synchronized in lower- and higher-order sensory areas and in corticolimbic emotion circuits. Negative valence was associated with increased ISC in the emotion-processing network (thalamus, ventral striatum, insula) and in the default-mode network (precuneus, temporoparietal junction, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus). High arousal was associated with increased ISC in the somatosensory cortices and visual and dorsal attention networks comprising the visual cortex, bilateral intraparietal sulci, and frontal eye fields. Seed-voxel-based correlation analysis confirmed that these sets of regions constitute dissociable, functional networks. We propose that negative valence synchronizes individuals' brain areas supporting emotional sensations and understanding of another's actions, whereas high arousal directs individuals' attention to similar features of the environment. By enhancing the synchrony of brain activity across individuals, emotions may promote social interaction and facilitate interpersonal understanding.},

abstract = {Two graphical techniques, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and what might be termed "confidence-accuracy characteristic" (CAC) analysis, are important tools for investigating variables that affect the accuracy of eyewitness identifications (e.g., type of lineup, exposure duration, same-race vs. other-race identifications, etc.). CAC analysis (a close relative of calibration analysis) consists of simply plotting suspect identification accuracy for each level of confidence. Two parties interested in the results of such investigations include (1) legal policymakers (e.g., state legislators and police chiefs) and (2) triers of guilt and innocence (e.g., judges and jurors). Which type of analysis is the most relevant to which party? The answer is largely a matter of whether the variable in question is a system variable or an estimator variable. ROC analysis, which measures discriminability, is critical for understanding system variables that affect eyewitness accuracy (e.g., the best lineup procedures). Thus, policymakers should be particularly attuned to the results of ROC analysis when making decisions about those variables. CAC analysis, which directly measures the confidence-accuracy relationship for suspect IDs, is critical for understanding the effect of estimator variables on eyewitness accuracy (e.g., exposure duration). Thus, triers of guilt and innocence should be particularly attuned to the results of CAC analysis. The utility of both analyses to system and estimator variables is illustrated by examining both types of analyses on previously published experiments and new experiments.},

In particular, we discuss 1) how conceptualizing perception and action as inference-control loops yields a joint computational perspective on brain-world and brain-body interactions and 2) how the concrete formulation of this loop as a hierarchical Bayesian model points to key computational quantities that inform a taxonomy of potential disease mechanisms. We consider the utility of this perspective for differential diagnosis in concrete clinical applications.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been substantial support for heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) as a treatment for a variety of disorders and for performance enhancement (Gevirtz, 2013). Since conditions as widely varied as asthma and depression seem to respond to this form of cardiorespiratory feedback training, the issue of possible mechanisms becomes more salient. The most supported possible mechanism is the strengthening of homeostasis in the baroreceptor (Vaschillo et al., 2002; Lehrer et al., 2003). Recently, the effect on the vagal afferent pathway to the frontal cortical areas has been proposed. In this article, we review these and other possible mechanisms that might explain the positive effects of HRVB.},

Perhaps the function of a partially out-of-phase phase relationship is to allow the greatest degree of flexibility to the organism,



At resting respira-tory rates, the phase relationship between breathing and HR is far from synchronous, such that heart rate increases tend to follow
inhalation at about the mid-breath point, and heart rate decreases follow exhalation also at about the mid-breath point (Vaschillo
et al., 2002).

Chaotic pattern of HRV: These can be described as “negative feedback loops,” which operate as closed loop system components that help maintain allostatic balance, while allowing adaptation to environmental demands (Lehrer and Eddie, 2013).

heart rate oscillations grows to many times the amplitude
at rest, while the pattern becomes simple and sinusoidal.


gas exchange at the alveoli is most efficient when heart rate starts
increasing at the beginning of inhalation, and starts decreasing
just as exhalation starts, i.e., a 0◦ phase relationship.


Respiratory sinus arrhythmia also can reflect aspects of auto-nomic function. It is controlled entirely by the vagus nerve,
such that vagus nerve outputs to the sinoatrial node primarily
occur only during exhalation.

Forty-one participants reappraised situations depicted in unpleasant pictures by imagining those situations getting worse (increase), staying the same (maintain), or getting better (decrease). Reappraisal instructions were delivered 2 s before (anticipatory) or 4 s after (online) picture onset. Measures of rated unpleasantness, expressive behavior (corrugator muscle activity), heart rate (HR), and electrodermal activity (EDA) were collected. Increase reappraisals produced higher rated unpleasantness, corrugator muscle activity, HR, and EDA relative to maintain reappraisals. For corrugator muscle activity and EDA, the effect of increase reappraisals was only apparent when enacted online. Decrease reappraisals produced lower rated unpleasantness relative to maintain reappraisals but had no effect on expressive behavior or autonomic physiology. The effect of decrease reappraisals did not depend on when reappraisal was enacted. These data underscore the importance of regulatory goals and the impact of regulatory timing as a moderator of emotion regulatory success within an emotion episode.},

abstract = {Disturbed sympathetic and also parasympathetic activ-ity of the autonomic nervous system points to patholo-gical alterations in the cardiovascular system. Untreated hypertensive subjects were examined with respect to the question of whether an increase in sympathetic activity necessarily goes along with a reduction in parasympathetic activity, and whether 'delayed' recov-ery behaviour after mental stress could be an indicator of a disturbed cardiovascular function. In 20 male hypertensive (HT) and 20 normotensive (NT) subjects (control group), heart rate variability (HRV) was com-pared during rest and under mental stress. The testing procedure consisted of the following phases: habitua-tion, arithmetic tasks without and with interference, recovery. HRV was analysed using the trigonometric regressive spectral analysis (TRS). Proceeding from the total variance (ms 2), the weighted averaged frequency (Hz) and the variance parts (ms 2) in the frequency bands 'low frequency' (LF-band: 0.04–0.15 Hz) and 'high fre-quency' (HF-band: 0.15–0.40 Hz) were explored. The variance part modulated by spontaneous breathing within the HF-band was assessed additionally. The variance part in the LF-band under mental stress was significantly increased in the HT group (Po0.01). Activity in the HF-band (without the respiration-depen-dent part) under mental stress did not differ between both groups, whereas the breathing-modulated part of variance in the HF-band was reduced in the HT subjects. During the recovery period in the HT group, the weighted averaged frequency was still elevated com-pared to baseline, and the variance part in the LF-band was increased, which may point to delayed recovery behaviour. In addition, by using a discriminant analysis 85{\%} of all subjects were reclassified to the original groups, all HT subjects being assigned 'correctly'. Spectral variance parameters enable early discovery of altered cardiovascular regulation. Respiration influ-ences variance in the HF-band in hypertensive subjects and should therefore be paid attention to. The variance part in the LF-band, weighted averaged frequency and the respiration-modulated variance in the HF-band turned out to be the most valid parameters for the differentiation between NT and HT subjects.},

abstract = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in
phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report
is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments.
After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the
quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the
dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits.
This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective
phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact
also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several
applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The
aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field
of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.},

abstract = {Reading speed is commonly used as an index of reading fluency. However, reading speed is not a consistent predictor of text comprehension, when speed and comprehension are measured on the same text within the same reader. This might be due to the somewhat ambiguous nature of reading speed, which is sometimes regarded as a feature of the reading process, and sometimes as a product of that process. We argue that both reading speed and comprehension should be seen as the result of the reading process, and that the process of fluent text reading can instead be described by complexity metrics that quantify aspects of the stability of the reading process. In this article, we introduce complexity metrics in the context of reading and apply them to data from a self-paced reading study. In this study, children and adults read a text silently or aloud and answered comprehension questions after reading. Our results show that recurrence metrics that quantify the degree of temporal structure in reading times yield better prediction of text comprehension compared to reading speed. However, the results for fractal metrics are less clear. Furthermore, prediction of text comprehension is generally strongest and most consistent across silent and oral reading when comprehension scores are normalized by reading speed. Analyses of word length and word frequency indicate that the observed complexity in reading times is not a simple function of the lexical properties of the text, suggesting that text reading might work differently compared to reading of isolated word or sentences.},

abstract = {Recent research has shown that heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs), brain activity in response to heartbeats, are a useful neural measure for investigating the functional role of brain–body interactions in cognitive processes including self-consciousness. In 2 experiments, using intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated (1) the neural sources of HEPs, (2) the underlying mechanisms for HEP generation, and (3) the functional role of HEPs in bodily self-consciousness. In Experiment-1, we found that shortly after the heartbeat onset, phase distributions across single trials were significantly concentrated in 10{\%} of the recording sites, mainly in the insula and the operculum, but also in other regions including the amygdala and fronto-temporal cortex. Such phase concentration was not accompanied by increased spectral power, and did not correlate with spectral power changes, suggesting that a phase resetting, rather than an additive “evoked potential” mechanism, underlies HEP generation. In Experiment-2, we further aimed to anatomically refine previous scalp EEG data that linked HEPs with bodily self-consciousness. We found that HEP modulations in the insula reflected an experimentally induced altered sense of self-identification. Collectively, these results provide novel and solid electrophysiological evidence on the neural sources and underlying mechanisms of HEPs, and their functional role in self-consciousness.},

We investigated whether these "cardio-visual" signals could modulate bodily self-consciousness and tactile perception. We report two main findings. First, synchronous cardio-visual signals increased self-identification with and self-location toward the virtual body, and second, they altered the perception of tactile stimuli applied to participants' backs so that touch was mislocalized toward the virtual body. We argue that the integration of signals from the inside and the outside of the human body is a fundamental neurobiological process underlying self-consciousness.},

Despite considerable evidence to the contrary, this remains widely accepted and for nearly a century has left the issue of whether visceral afferent signals are essential for emotional experience unresolved. Here we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging and multiorgan physiological recording to dissect experience of two distinct disgust forms and their relationship to peripheral and central physiological activity. We show that experience of core and body-boundary-violation disgust are dissociable in both peripheral autonomic and central neural responses and also that emotional experience specific to anterior insular activity encodes these different underlying patterns of peripheral physiological responses. These findings demonstrate that organ-specific physiological responses differentiate emotional feeling states and support the hypothesis that central representations of organism physiological homeostasis constitute a critical aspect of the neural basis of feelings.},

In truth, we and others prefer ROC analysis for applied purposes because it provides an atheoretical measure of empirical discriminability (namely, partial area-under-the-curve, or pAUC). The issue of underlying theoretical discriminability only arises when theoreticians seek to explain why one eyewitness identification procedure yields a higher pAUC than another. Lampinen (2016) also argued that favoring the procedure that yields a higher pAUC can lead to an irrational decision outcome. However, his argument depends on needlessly restricting which points from two ROCs can be compared. As a general rule, the maximum-utility point will fall somewhere on the higher ROC, underscoring the need for ROC analysis. Thus, Lampinen's (2016) arguments against the usefulness of ROC analysis are unfounded.},

abstract = {Emotion discrimination, emotion regulation, and cognitive control are three related, yet separable processes that emerge over the course of development. The current study tested 100 children, adolescents, and adults on an Emotional Go/Nogo task, illustrating the ability of this paradigm to identify the unique developmental patterns for each of these three processes in the context of both positive (happy) and negative emotions (fear, sad, and anger), across three different age groups. Consistent with previous literature, our findings show that emotion discrimination and regulatory abilities (both cognitive control and emotion regulation) improve steadily for each age group, with each age group showing unique patterns of performance. The findings suggest that emotion regulation is constructed from basic cognition control and emotion discrimination skills. The patterns of behavior from the Emotional Go/Nogo task provide normative benchmark data across a wide range of emotions that can be used for future behavioral and neuroimaging studies that examine the developmental construction of emotion regulatory processes.},

abstract = {The purposes of the present study were to determine the autonomic origins of a bradycardiac response to a moderate intensity nonsignal auditory stimulus and the changes in autonomic cardiac control of this response as a function of habituation. Ss were 20 college students. Pure tone stimuli were repeatedly presented to participants while phasic changes in heart period (HP), preejection period (PEP), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were observed. Tone stimuli initially elicited an increase in HP, an increase in RSA, and a decrease in PEP, suggesting a coactivation of the parasympathetic and sympathetic inputs mediating changes in the bradycardiac HP response. As expected, HP responses habituated with repeated presentations of the tones. PEP and RSA responses, however, demonstrated different habituation rates than HP These data demonstrate that cardiodeceleratory responses to nonsignal stimuli can arise from changes in activity of both autonomic divisions and document the importance of considering the autonomic origins of habituating cardiac responses in order to fully understand the process of response habituation.

we addressed the idea that breathing may contribute to timing and coordination

breathing were analysed in unconstrained face-to-face conversations involving
female speakers. No overall relationship between breathing and turn-taking
rates was observed, as breathing rate was specific to the subjects' activity in
dialogue (listening versus taking the turn versus holding the turn). A general
inter-personal coordination of breathing over the whole conversation was not
evident. However, specific coordinative patterns were observed in shorter
time-windows when participants engaged in taking turns. The type of turntaking
had an effect on the respective coordination in breathing. Most of the
smooth and interrupted turns were taken just after an inhalation, with specific
profiles of alignment to partner breathing. Unsuccessful attempts to take the
turn were initiated late in the exhalation phase and with no clear inter-personal
coordination. Finally, breathing profiles at turn-taking were different than
those at turn-holding. The results support the idea that breathing is actively

First, participants learned to decrease heart rate using biofeedback. Then, inter-individual differences in the acquired skill predicted how well they could decrease heart rate reactivity when later exposed to negative arousing pictures without biofeedback. These findings suggest that (i) short lasting biofeedback training improves heart rate regulation and (ii) the learned ability transfers to emotion challenging situations without biofeedback.

Neuroimaging studies mainly investigated regularity processing for exteroceptive sensory inputs (i.e. from outside the body). Here we investigated whether interoceptive signals (i.e. from inside the body) can mediate auditory regularity processing. Human participants passively listened to sound sequences presented in synchrony or asynchrony to their heartbeat while concomitant electroencephalography was recorded. We hypothesized that the cardio-audio synchronicity would induce a brain expectation of future sounds. Electrical neuroimaging analysis revealed a surprise response at 158–270 ms upon omission of the expected sounds in the synchronous condition only. Control analyses ruled out that this effect was trivially based on expectation from the auditory temporal structure or on differences in heartbeat physiological signals.

For both recurrence and spectral spaces, features were selected using a cluster measure defined by the Davies-Bouldin index and the classification stage was based on linear discriminant analysis. As the main result, it was found that the threshold $\epsilon$ of the recurrence plot, chosen so as to yield a recurrence rate of 2.5{\%}, defined the key discriminant feature, typically providing a mean classification error of less than 2{\%} when information from 4 electrodes was used.

@article{Segerstrom,
abstract = {—Experimental research reliably demonstrates that self-regulatory deficits are a consequence of prior self-regulatory effort. However, in naturalistic settings, al-though people know that they are sometimes vulnerable to saying, eating, or doing the wrong thing, they cannot ac-curately gauge their capacity to self-regulate at any given time. Because self-regulation and autonomic regulation colocalize in the brain, an autonomic measure, heart rate variability (HRV), could provide an index of self-regula-tory strength and activity. During an experimental ma-nipulation of self-regulation (eating carrots or cookies), HRV was elevated during high self-regulatory effort (eat carrots, resist cookies) compared with low self-regulatory effort (eat cookies, resist carrots). The experimental ma-nipulation and higher HRV at baseline independently predicted persistence at a subsequent anagram task. HRV appears to index self-regulatory strength and effort, making it possible to study these phenomena in the field as well as the lab. A number of problems of modern life stem from failures of self-regulation, the ability to control one's own thoughts, emotions, and behavior. Failure to inhibit the impulse to eat is in part responsible for obesity, for example, and failure to control anger can result in interpersonal aggression. Many such failures are unplanned; that is, they are lapses of self-regulation rather than intended acts. Why do people act contrary to their intentions? Experimental evidence indicates that self-regulatory strength— the ability to meet self-regulatory demands such as inhibiting impulses, making decisions, persisting at difficult tasks, and controlling emotions—is a resource that can be spent. In a series of studies, expending self-regulatory strength by eating un-desirable foods in the presence of desirable foods, making choices, and suppressing thoughts or emotions created subse-quent deficits in persistence at and performance on cognitive and motor tasks (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, {\&} Tice, 1998; Muraven, Tice, {\&} Baumeister, 1998). Self-regulatory strength may therefore be analogous to muscle strength: The more effort is expended, the more the self-regulatory ''muscle'' is fatigued, and the less strength remains for further efforts (Mu-raven {\&} Baumeister, 2000). This fatigue can lead to lapses of self-regulation. A difference between muscle fatigue and self-regulatory fa-tigue, however, is that people are not aware of self-regulatory fatigue. People do not report substantial differences in their appraisals of tasks that require self-regulatory effort versus tasks that do not, nor do they report differential affective conse-quences of those tasks (Baumeister et al., 1998; Muraven et al., 1998). Without an index of self-regulatory strength and fatigue—an electromyograph for the self-regulatory muscle— the concept of self-regulatory strength is difficult to apply empirically to naturalistic settings, in which a failure of self-regulation (e.g., eating a doughnut while on a diet) could be construed both as the indicator of self-regulatory fatigue and as the consequence of that fatigue. Unraveling this tautology re-quires the ability to measure how much self-regulatory strength people have available, how much self-regulatory effort they are expending, and whether they are vulnerable to the negative consequences of self-regulatory fatigue. A measure of parasympathetic control over the heart, heart rate variability (HRV), offers just such an opportunity. Para-sympathetic input to the heart via the efferent vagus nerve affects heart rate acceleration and deceleration related to res-piration: The heart speeds up after inspiration and slows down after expiration. More parasympathetic input results in more pronounced acceleration and deceleration and more variable intervals between heart beats, that is, higher HRV. HRV is a},

Given the efficacy of HRV biofeedback (BF) for treating asthma, the large autonomic effects of HRV BF, and the link between vagus nerve activity and inflammation, we hypothesized that HRV BF would dampen the acute manifestations of systemic inflammation induced by LPS challenge. Healthy participants age 18-40 were randomly assigned to four-one-hour training sessions of either HRV BF (n = 6) or a control 15/min paced breathing condition (n = 5) prior to acute experimentally induced LPS exposure. Participants were coached to do the procedures for 10 min each at five hourly time points after LPS injection, and then 2 h later. Subjective symptoms, HRV parameters, and plasma cytokine levels were measured at each time point, 2 h afterward, and the following morning. Participants were able to perform the procedures both during four pre-exposure training sessions and while experiencing LPS-induced symptoms. The HRV BF group showed significant attenuation of the LPS-induced decline in HRV for the 6 h following LPS exposure, suggesting that HRV BF decreased autonomic dysfunction produced by LPS-induced inflammation. HRV BF also reduced symptoms of headache and eye sensitivity to light, but did not affect LPS-induced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines or symptoms of nausea, muscle aches, or feverishness. Further evaluation of HRV BF appears to be warranted among patients with inflammatory conditions.},

abstract = {Many depressed adolescents experience difficulty regulating their emotions. These emotion regulation difficulties appear to emerge in part from socialization processes within families and then generalize to other contexts. However, emotion dysregulation is typically assessed within the individual, rather than in the social relationships that shape and maintain dysregulation. In this study, we evaluated concordance of physiological and observational measures of emotion dysregulation during interpersonal conflict, using a multilevel actor-partner interdependence model (APIM). Participants were 75 mother-daughter dyads, including 50 depressed adolescents with or without a history of self-injury, and 25 typically developing controls. Behavior dysregulation was operationalized as observed aversiveness during a conflict discussion, and physiological dysregulation was indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Results revealed different patterns of concordance for control versus depressed participants. Controls evidenced a concordant partner (between-person) effect, and showed increased physiological regulation during minutes when their partner was more aversive. In contrast, clinical dyad members displayed a concordant actor (within-person) effect, becoming simultaneously physiologically and behaviorally dysregulated. Results inform current understanding of emotion dysregulation across multiple levels of analysis.},

abstract = {Pupil diameter was monitored during picture viewing to assess effects of hedonic valence and emotional arousal on pupillary responses. Autonomic activity (heart rate and skin conductance) was concurrently measured to determine whether pupillary changes are mediated by parasympathetic or sympathetic activation. Following an initial light reflex, pupillary changes were larger when viewing emotionally arousing pictures, regardless of whether these were pleasant or unpleasant. Pupillary changes during picture viewing covaried with skin conductance change, supporting the interpretation that sympathetic nervous system activity modulates these changes in the context of affective picture viewing. Taken together, the data provide strong support for the hypothesis that the pupil's response during affective picture viewing reflects emotional arousal associated with increased sympathetic activity.},

abstract = {Attention to internal body sensations is practiced inmost meditation traditions. Many traditions state that this practice results in increased awareness of internal body sensations, but scientific studies evaluating this claim are lacking. We predicted that experienced meditators would display performance superior to that of nonmeditators on heartbeat detection, a standard noninvasive measure of resting interoceptive awareness. We compared two groups of meditators (Tibetan Buddhist and Kundalini) to an age- and body mass index-matched group of nonmeditators. Contrary to our prediction, we found no evidence that meditators were superior to nonmeditators in the heartbeat detection task, across several sessions and respiratory modulation conditions. Compared to nonmeditators, however, meditators consistently rated their interoceptive performance as superior and the difficulty of the task as easier. These results provide evidence against the notion that practicing attention to internal body sensations, a core feature of meditation, enhances the ability to sense the heartbeat at rest.},

abstract = {Interpersonal touch is of paramount importance in human social bonding and close relationships, allowing a unique channel for affect communication. So far the effect of touch on human physiology has been studied at an individual level. The present study aims at extending the study of affective touch from isolated individuals to truly interacting dyads. We have designed an ecological paradigm where romantic partners interact only via touch and we manipulate their empathic states. Simultaneously, we collected their autonomic activity (skin conductance, pulse, respiration). Fourteen couples participated to the experiment. We found that interpersonal touch increased coupling of electrodermal activity between the interacting partners, regardless the intensity and valence of the emotion felt. In addition, physical touch induced strong and reliable changes in physiological states within individuals. These results support an instrumental role of interpersonal touch for affective support in close relationships. Furthermore, they suggest that touch alone allows the emergence of a somatovisceral resonance between interacting individuals, which in turn is likely to form the prerequisites for emotional contagion and empathy.},

Within 500 ms of onset, blinks were first greatly facilitated and then inhibited, indicating prepulse facilitation and prepulse inhibition that did not vary with affect. Attention allocation to the picture continued across the viewing interval and was most pronounced for emotional pictures, as determined by attenuation of the P3 component to the startle probe. Startle potentiation for unpleasant pictures occurred later in the viewing interval and was strongest for highly arousing pictures. Taken together, the startle reflex during picture viewing is modulated by sequential and sometimes concurrent processes of prepulse facilitation, prepulse inhibition, attentional inhibition, and affective modulation, with reflex magnitude reflecting the net effect of multiple processes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Decreased vagal activity after myocardial infarction results in reduced heart-rate variability and increased risk of death. To distinguish between vagal and sympathetic factors that affect heart-rate variability, we used a signal-processing algorithm to separately characterise deceleration and acceleration of heart rate. We postulated that diminished deceleration-related modulation of heart rate is an important prognostic marker. Our prospective hypotheses were that deceleration capacity is a better predictor of risk than left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN). 

METHODS
We quantified heart rate deceleration capacity by assessing 24-h Holter recordings from a post-infarction cohort in Munich (n=1455). We blindly validated the prognostic power of deceleration capacity in post-infarction populations in London, UK (n=656), and Oulu, Finland (n=600). We tested our hypotheses by assessment of the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). 

FINDINGS
During a median follow-up of 24 months, 70 people died in the Munich cohort and 66 in the London cohort. The Oulu cohort was followed-up for 38 months and 77 people died. In the London cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0{\textperiodcentered}80 (SD 0{\textperiodcentered}03) compared with 0{\textperiodcentered}67 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for LVEF and 0{\textperiodcentered}69 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for SDNN. In the Oulu cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0{\textperiodcentered}74 (0{\textperiodcentered}03) compared with 0{\textperiodcentered}60 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for LVEF and 0{\textperiodcentered}64 (0{\textperiodcentered}03) for SDNN (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 for all comparisons). Stratification by dichotomised deceleration capacity was especially powerful in patients with preserved LVEF (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 in all cohorts). 

INTERPRETATION
Impaired heart rate deceleration capacity is a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction and is more accurate than LVEF and the conventional measures of heart-rate variability.},

Research into both of these areas is relatively new, and while several reviews have emerged for each area independently, none has directly proposed a conceptual integration. The current review explores how key axioms and assumptions of traditional psychological models of emotion regulation and the psychological interventions that are derived from them (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy) differ fundamentally from mindfulness-based approaches in terms of the underlying processes they address. Accordingly, mindfulness and emotion regulation are each reviewed, followed by a conceptual integration. Fundamental difficulties arising from the attempt to integrate the two domains are highlighted, especially as to the “reality” of thoughts, the relationship between thoughts and emotions, and the need to move beyond a valence model of emotion. Finally, a model is proposed outlining the likely critical processes and mechanisms that underlie “mindful emotion regulation.”},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Laborde, Mosley and Thayer. Psychophysiological research integrating heart rate variability (HRV) has increased during the last two decades, particularly given the fact that HRV is able to index cardiac vagal tone. Cardiac vagal tone, which represents the contribution of the parasympathetic nervous system to cardiac regulation, is acknowledged to be linked with many phenomena relevant for psychophysiological research, including self-regulation at the cognitive, emotional, social, and health levels. The ease of HRV collection and measurement coupled with the fact it is relatively affordable, non-invasive and pain free makes it widely accessible to many researchers. This ease of access should not obscure the difficulty of interpretation of HRV findings that can be easily misconstrued, however, this can be controlled to some extent through correct methodological processes. Standards of measurement were developed two decades ago by a Task Force within HRV research, and recent reviews updated several aspects of the Task Force paper. However, many methodological aspects related to HRV in psychophysiological research have to be considered if one aims to be able to draw sound conclusions, which makes it difficult to interpret findings and to compare results across laboratories. Those methodological issues have mainly been discussed in separate outlets, making difficult to get a grasp on them, and thus this paper aims to address this issue. It will help to provide psychophysiological researchers with recommendations and practical advice concerning experimental designs, data analysis, and data reporting. This will ensure that researchers starting a project with HRV and cardiac vagal tone are well informed regarding methodological considerations in order for their findings to contribute to knowledge advancement in their field.},

The primary aim of this review article is to highlight recent advances in the study of body-ownership and our understanding of the underlying neurocognitive processes in three ways. I first consider how the sense of body-ownership has been investigated and elucidated in the context of multisensory integration. Beyond exteroception, recent studies have considered how this exteroceptively-driven sense of body-ownership can be linked to the other side of embodiment, that of the unobservable, yet felt interoceptive body, suggesting that these two sides of embodiment interact to provide a unifying bodily self. Lastly, the multisensorial understanding of the self has shown to have implications for our understanding of social relationships, especially in the context of self-other boundaries. Taken together, these three research strands motivate a unified model of the self inspired by current predictive coding models.},

It is not clear, however, whether beliefs about the likelihood of success in emotion regulation can shape actual emotion regulation success. To test this possibility, we manipulated participants' beliefs about the likelihood of success in emotion regulation and assessed their subsequent ability to regulate their emotions during a negative emotion induction. We found that participants who were led to expect emotion regulation to be more successful were subsequently more successful in regulating their emotional responses, compared to participants in the control condition. Our findings demonstrate that expected success can contribute to actual success in emotion regulation.},

Emotional pictures elicited a larger late positive potential than neutral pictures in a 400-700-ms window over centro-parietal sensors both for pictures with simple figure-ground composition and for more complex scenes. Picture composition affected ERPs beginning earlier (around 150 ms), with simple figure-ground compositions eliciting less positivity over posterior sensors and less negativity over frontal sensors. Emotionality had little effect on modulation of these early ERPs. These data suggest that the late centro-parietal positive potential primarily reflects motivational relevance, and that earlier posterior (and anterior) components reflect, at least in part, differences in a picture's perceptual organization.},

The shape of the two-dimensional affective space defined by the mean ratings for each sound was similar to that previously obtained for pictures, and, like memory for pictures, free recall was highest for emotionally arousing stimuli. In Experiment 2, autonomic and facial electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded while a new group of subjects listened to the same set of sounds; the startle reflex was measured using visual probes. Listening to unpleasant sounds resulted in larger startle reflexes, more corrugator EMG activity, and larger heart rate deceleration compared with listening to pleasant sounds. Electrodermal reactions were larger for emotionally arousing than for neutral materials.

abstract = {Do partners' levels of physiological arousal become linked in close relationships? The term physiological linkage describes covariation between people in their moment-to-moment physiological states. The current review presents a conceptual framework to guide research on linkage in romantic relationships and discusses the potential implications of being linked. Evidence of linkage was found across a broad range of physiological indices and in a variety of contexts, including during laboratory-based conflict and in daily life. Four hypotheses regarding how linkage relates to individual and interpersonal functioning are evaluated: (a) coactivation of the sympathetic nervous system or the hypothalamic–pituitary adrenal axis is “bad,” (b) moderate physiological linkage is “just right,” (c) physiological linkage is problematic if the individual or couple is overloaded, and (d) the implications of physiological linkage depend on the emotional context. We found partial support for the first hypothesis and determined that more research is needed to evaluate the remaining hypotheses. Linkage in cortisol was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction; but, at the same time, linkage in multiple systems was positively associated with indices of relationship connectedness, such as the amount of time spent together and the ability to identify the emotions of one's partner. These results suggest that linkage may confer benefits but also may put couples at risk if they become entrenched in patterns of conflict or stress. With research in this area burgeoning in recent years, this review indicates that linkage is a promising construct with applications for interventions targeting individual health and couple functioning.},

abstract = {Discriminating accurate from mistaken eyewitness identifications is a major issue facing criminal justice systems. This study examined whether eyewitness confidence assists such decisions under a variety of conditions using a confidence-accuracy (CA) calibration approach. Participants (N = 1,200) viewed a simulated crime and attempted 2 separate identifications from 8-person target-present or target-absent lineups. Confidence and accuracy were calibrated for choosers (but not nonchoosers) for both targets under all conditions. Lower overconfidence was associated with higher diagnosticity, lower target-absent base rates, and shorter identification latencies. Although researchers agree that courtroom expressions of confidence are uninformative, our findings indicate that confidence assessments obtained immediately after a positive identification can provide a useful guide for investigators about the likely accuracy of an identification.

abstract = {Emotion regulation is the ability to recruit processes to influence emotion generation. In recent years there has been mounting interest in how emotions are regulated at behavioural and neural levels, as well as in the relevance of emotional dysregulation to psychopathology. During adolescence, brain regions involved in affect generation and regulation, including the limbic system and prefrontal cortex, undergo protracted structural and functional development. Adolescence is also a time of increasing vulnerability to internalising and externalising psychopathologies associated with poor emotion regulation, including depression, anxiety and antisocial behaviour. It is therefore of particular interest to understand how emotion regulation develops over this time, and how this relates to ongoing brain development. However, to date relatively little research has addressed these questions directly. This review will discuss existing research in these areas in both typical adolescence and in adolescent psychopathology, and will highlight opportunities for future research. In particular, it is important to consider the social context in which adolescent emotion regulation develops. It is possible that while adolescence may be a time of vulnerability to emotional dysregulation, scaffolding the development of emotion regulation during this time may be a fruitful preventative target for psychopathology.},

@article{Eckberg1997,
abstract = {Given the importance of the autonomic nervous system to cardiovascular health, it is not surprising that there is and has been great interest in measurements of human sympathetic and vagus nerve traffic as tools that might inform physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. Pagani and coworkers1 advanced the provocative notion that the instantaneous balance between sympathetic and vagal nerve activities can be captured by a single number, obtained by dividing RR-interval spectral power centered at ≈0.1 Hz by spectral power centered at higher, primarily respiratory frequencies. This ratio, or sympathovagal balance, has been embraced with great enthusiasm2 because it offers new possibilities for understanding dynamic, critically important autonomic interrelations in humans by the use of totally noninvasive, unobtrusive means.3 The broad bases for this mathematical treatment are as follows: (1) 0.1-Hz RR intervals are importantly mediated by fluctuations of sympathetic nerve activity; (2) higher-frequency RR-interval rhythms are mediated almost exclusively by fluctuations of vagal-cardiac nerve activity; and (3) physiological interventions tend to provoke reciprocal changes of sympathetic and vagal neural outflows. Sympathovagal balance, the ratio of these periodicities, is taken to reflect the balance between the opposing neural mechanisms. This review examines the physiological foundations of sympathovagal balance. Previous Section Next Section The Method and Its Mathematics The ECG is recorded with the subject in a steady state (when rhythms are stationary) for a period sufficiently long to define events occurring over frequencies of interest. RR-interval spectral power is calculated from this series of intervals with an autoregressive algorithm, which yields center frequencies and absolute power of component fluctuations, based on a model whose order (the number of parameters) is selected automatically to minimize Akaike's information criterion statistic.4 (The statistical uncertainty and consequences of the automatic selection of the autoregressive model have not been defined fully; however, it is clear that the model order importantly determines both center frequency and magnitude of spectral peaks.5) Autoregressive analyses of short (≤5 minutes) RR-interval time series typically yield three peaks in very low (0 to 0.04 Hz; VLF), low (0.04 to 0.15 Hz; LF), and respiratory or high (0.15 to 0.40 Hz; HF) frequency ranges.6 Published examples (Fig 1⇓ in Reference 11 and Figs 5c⇓ and 5d⇓ in Reference 66 ) suggest that in such short-term recordings, these three frequencies account for almost all spectral power (in the examples, 94.6{\%}, 96.1{\%}, and 98.5{\%}). Therefore, in practice, power in normalized (also called relative or fractional) units (nu) is power centered at the frequency of interest (LF or HF) divided by total power less power at VLFs. Thus, LF nu=LF/(LF+HF) and HF nu=HF/(LF+HF). Sympathovagal balance is the ratio between LF and respiratory-frequency powers. Sympathovagal balance (in dimensionless units) is simply the ratio of absolute LF to absolute HF power, or LF/HF. Figure 1.

Direct multifiber vagal-cardiac (VND) and sympathetic-cardiac (SND) nerve recordings from one anesthetized, decerebrate cat. Reproduced with permission.3 imp. indicates impulse; PSD, power spectral density. Several consequences issue from the mathematics of sympathovagal balance. First, a change of either the numerator or the denominator must change the fraction. Thus, a reduction of LF with no change of HF will reduce the fraction, and a reduction of HF with no change of LF will increase the fraction. According to published precedents,1,3 the former change would be interpreted as a shift of sympathovagal balance toward vagal predominance and the latter as a shift of sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic predominance. Second, because calculations of normalized LF and HF powers involve merely rearrangement of the same LF and HF terms, a change of normalized LF power must necessarily be associated with a change of normalized HF power. For the same reason, relations among the different calculated values can be predicted simply on the basis of mathematics. For example, if LF and HF are distributed nearly normally, sympathovagal balance, plotted as a function of normalized LF power, will be almost exponential. The remaining discussion touches on some of the physiological and pathophysiological processes that contribute to sympathovagal balance. The discussion is organized as a series of postulates that I believe tacitly or explicitly underlie the concept. The Numerator Human cardiovascular rhythms occurring at ≈0.1 Hz are of great interest because they convey information regarding activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Healthy humans may have strong fluctuations of muscle sympathetic nerve activity about every 10 seconds,7 a period that is sufficiently long for vascular smooth muscle and sinoatrial node effectors to respond to released norepinephrine and to modulate arterial pressure and heart rate.8 LF RR-Interval Rhythms Reflect Sympathetic Nerve Traffic to the Heart Malliani and coworkers3 published what may be the only power spectral analyses of sympathetic and vagus nerve traffic assumed but not proven to be destined for the heart. Fig 1⇑ shows preganglionic thoracic sympathetic and vagus nerve discharges measured from one artificially ventilated decerebrate cat. My integration of the two LF spectral powers in this figure suggests that sympathetic spectral power is ≈15{\%} greater than vagal spectral power. Kingwell and colleagues9 studied healthy supine subjects and found no significant correlation between myocardial norepinephrine spillover and absolute or relative 0.1-Hz RR-interval spectral power. Saul and coworkers10 also studied healthy supine subjects and found no significant correlation between baseline peroneal sympathetic nerve activity expressed as bursts/min (or antecubital vein plasma norepinephrine levels) and absolute or normalized LF heart rate spectral power. Hopf et al11 and Introna et al12 measured RR-interval spectral power before and after high spinal anesthesia. Sympathetic blockade in the supine position (but see responses to tilt below) did not alter absolute or relative 0.1-Hz RR-interval spectral power significantly. Pagani et al1 reported that propranolol 0.2 mg/kg IV does not reduce normalized 0.1-Hz RR-interval spectral power significantly. Moreover, Jokkel et al13 reported that short-term $\beta$-adrenergic blockade actually increases 0.1-Hz frequency RR-interval spectral power. Long-term $\beta$-adrenergic blockade reduces normalized 0.1-Hz RR-interval spectral power.1 Low-dose cholinergic blocking drugs, such as atropine and scopolamine, paradoxically increase average RR intervals14 and LF RR-interval spectral power.15 Increased LF spectral power is unlikely to be due to increased sympathetic nerve traffic because atropine does not alter (muscle) sympathetic nerve activity or plasma norepinephrine levels.16 Conversely, large-dose atropine abolishes nearly all RR-interval spectral power in LF as well as HF ranges.17,18 The simplest interpretation of the effects of large-dose atropine is that it blocks sinoatrial responses to acetylcholine released by vagus nerve traffic; atropine does not alter heart rate in the absence of vagus nerve activity.19 Thus, vagal contributions to baseline LF RR-interval fluctuations are great, and evidence that baseline LF RR-interval spectral power is related quantitatively to sympathetic-cardiac nerve traffic is nonexistent. Changes of 0.1-Hz RR-Interval Spectral Power Reflect Changes of Sympathetic-Cardiac Nerve Traffic Two groups have sought correlations between muscle sympathetic nerve traffic and heart rate or RR-interval spectral power over a range of arterial pressures provoked by graded infusions of nitroprusside and phenylephrine. Saul and coworkers10 found significant correlations between sympathetic nerve activity, expressed as bursts/min, and normalized LF heart rate spectral power, but only in 4 of 10 subjects studied. Pagani and associates20 found no significant correlation between sympathetic nerve activity, expressed as bursts/min, and normalized LF RR-interval spectral power. However, Pagani did find a highly significant but probably weak correlation between sympathetic nerve activity, expressed as burst area per second, and normalized LF RR-interval spectral power. The studies by Saul et al10 and Pagani et al20 differ in several respects. First, Saul normalized sympathetic bursts; Pagani did not. Normalization is necessary because burst heights differ among individuals; if sympathetic activity is not normalized, subjects with large sympathetic bursts will dominate average results. Second, subjects in the study by Saul et al controlled their breathing frequencies; those in the study by Pagani et al did not. As discussed below, breathing frequency profoundly influences spectral power measurements. Third, Saul reported individual regressions; Pagani did not. (It cannot be determined from the article by Pagani et al if there is a significant correlation between muscle sympathetic burst area per second and normalized LF RR-interval spectral power.) Rather, Pagani used a nonparametric regression analysis (Theil21) of all his data, both within and across subjects. This may have been inappropriate, because the Theil method requires that data be stochastically independent. Repeated measures (seven in each subject) violate this condition. Koh and coworkers18 also measured RR-interval spectral power during infusions of nitroprusside and phenylephrine. Fig 2⇓ shows RR-interval spectral power of healthy subjects and patients with complete high cervical spinal cord injuries during saline infusion and two or three levels of nitroprusside and phenylephrine.

For properly powered studies replication rate should be around 80{\%}, whereas in practice less than 40{\%} of the studies selected from different areas of psychology can be replicated. Researchers in cognitive psychology are hindered in estimating the power of their studies, because the designs they use present a sample of stimulus materials to a sample of participants, a situation not covered by most power formulas. To remedy the situation, we review the literature related to the topic and introduce recent software packages, which we apply to the data of two masked priming studies with high power. We checked how we could estimate the power of each study and how much they could be reduced to remain powerful enough. On the basis of this analysis, we recommend that a properly powered reaction time experiment with repeated measures has at least 1,600 word observations per condition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli). This is considerably more than current practice. We also show that researchers must include the number of observations in meta-analyses because the effect sizes currently reported depend on the number of stimuli presented to the participants. Our analyses can easily be applied to new datasets gathered.},

abstract = {Successful emotion regulation is important for maintaining psychological well-being. Although it is known that emotion regulation strategies, such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, may have divergent consequences for emotional responses, the cognitive processes underlying these differences remain unclear. Here we used eye-tracking to investigate the role of attentional deployment in emotion regulation success. We hypothesized that differences in the deployment of attention to emotional areas of complex visual scenes may be a contributing factor to the differential effects of these two strategies on emotional experience. Eye-movements, pupil size, and self-reported negative emotional experience were measured while healthy young adult participants viewed negative IAPS images and regulated their emotional responses using either cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression. Consistent with prior work, reappraisers reported feeling significantly less negative than suppressers when regulating emotion as compared to a baseline condition. Across both groups, participants looked away from emotional areas during emotion regulation, an effect that was more pronounced for suppressers. Critically, irrespective of emotion regulation strategy, participants who looked toward emotional areas of a complex visual scene were more likely to experience emotion regulation success. Taken together, these results demonstrate that attentional deployment varies across emotion regulation strategies and that successful emotion regulation depends on the extent to which people look toward emotional content in complex visual scenes.

abstract = {In analyzing test data, it is often assumed that students were motivated to answer the items correctly, hence that the attribute of interest drove test performance. However, if the test is administered in a low-stakes administration condition or if students do not receive feedback, students might not put their best effort into answering the items correctly. Within the item response theory (IRT) framework, lack of motivation threatens the consistency of proficiency and item parameter estimation and therefore the usefulness of the IRT model. The goal of the current study was to explore to what extent a mixture Rasch model and the l z person-fit statistic could be used to model motivational differences in data administered in a low-stakes administration condition. In modeling the mixture Rasch model, constraints distinguished two latent classes of students: (1) a class representing “motivated” response behavior and (2) a class representing “unmotivated” response behavior. We investigated the usefulness of the mixture modeling strategy in a sample of primary-school students (N = 1,512) by comparing the posterior probabilities of the mixture Rasch model and the student's self-reported motivation. Furthermore, the study investigated the relationship between the student's self-reported motivation and the l z person-fit statistic.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the ef-fects of music and white noise on the recovery of physiolog-ical measures after stressful visual stimulation. Twenty-nine participants took part in the experiment. Visual stimulation with slides eliciting disgust was followed by subjectively pleasant music, sad music, and white noise in three consecu-tive sessions. The spectral power of the frontal and temporal EEG, skin conductance, heart rate, heart period variability, facial capillary blood flow, and respiration rate were recorded and analyzed. Aversive visual stimulation evoked heart rate deceleration, increased high frequency component of heart period variability, increased skin conductance level and skin conductance response frequency, decreased facial blood flow and velocity, decreased temporal slow alpha and increased frontal fast beta power in all three sessions. Both subjec-tively pleasant and sad music led to the restoration of base-line levels on most parameters; while white noise did not enhance the recovery process. The effects of pleasant mu-sic on post-stress recovery, when compared to white noise, were significantly different on heart rate, respiration rate, and peripheral blood flow. Both positive and negative music exerted positive modulatory effects on cardiovascular and respiratory activity, namely increased heart rate, balanced heart period variability, increased vascular blood flow and respiration rate during the post-stress recovery. Data only partially supported the " undoing " hypothesis, which states that positive emotions may facilitate the process of physio-logical recovery following negative emotions.},

abstract = {In contemporary philosophy of collective intentionality, emotions, feelings, moods, and sentiments do not figure prominently in debates on the explanation and justification of joint action. Received philosophical theories analyze joint action in terms of common knowledge of cognitively complex, interconnected structures of intentions and action plans of the participants. These theories admit that collective emotions sometimes give rise to joint action or more typically, unplanned and uncoordinated collective behavior that falls short of full-fledged jointly intentional action. In contrast, minimalist theorists pay some attention to affective elements in joint action without much concern about their collective intentionality. They refer to an association between low-level synchrony in perceptual, motor, and behavioral processes, and increased interpersonal liking, feelings of solidarity, and cooperativeness. In this paper, we outline an account of collective emotions that can bridge this theoretical divide, linking the intentional structure of joint actions and the underlying cognitive and affective mechanisms. Collective emotions can function as both motivating and justifying reasons for jointly intentional actions, in some cases even without prior joint intentions of the participants. Moreover, they facilitate coordination in joint action.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Recognising and representing one's self as distinct from others is a fundamental component of self-awareness. However, current theories of self-recognition are not embedded within global theories of cortical function and therefore fail to provide a compelling explanation of how the self is processed. We present a theoretical account of the neural and computational basis of self-recognition that is embedded within the free-energy account of cortical function. In this account one's body is processed in a Bayesian manner as the most likely to be " me " . Such probabilistic representation arises through the integration of information from hierarchically organised unimodal systems in higher-level multimodal areas. This infor-mation takes the form of bottom-up " surprise " signals from unimodal sensory systems that are explained away by top-down processes that minimise the level of surprise across the brain. We present evidence that this theoretical perspective may account for the findings of psychological and neuroimaging inves-tigations into self-recognition and particularly evidence that representations of the self are malleable, rather than fixed as previous accounts of self-recognition might suggest.},

We discuss existing evidence in support of the architecture as well as open questions that remain to be empirically addressed. In addition, we suggest possible interfaces between the minimal architecture and other approaches to joint action. The minimal architecture has implications for theorising about the emergence of joint action, for human–machine interaction, and for understanding how coordination can be facilitated by exploiting relations between multiple agents' actions and between actions and the environment.},

abstract = {Effective mental functioning requires that cognition be protected from emotional conflict due to interference by task-irrelevant emotionally salient stimuli. The neu-ral mechanisms by which the brain detects and re-solves emotional conflict are still largely unknown, however. Drawing on the classic Stroop conflict task, we developed a protocol that allowed us to dissociate the generation and monitoring of emotional conflict from its resolution. Using functional magnetic reso-nance imaging (fMRI), we find that activity in the amyg-dala and dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cor-tices reflects the amount of emotional conflict. By contrast, the resolution of emotional conflict is associ-ated with activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. Activation of the rostral cingulate is predicted by the amount of previous-trial conflict-related neural activity and is accompanied by a simultaneous and correlated reduction of amygdalar activity. These data suggest that emotional conflict is resolved through top-down inhibition of amygdalar activity by the ros-tral cingulate cortex.},

The present research investigated the link between action versus state orientation and implicit emotion regulation under demanding conditions. After inducing a demanding context, action-oriented participants displayed reduced affective priming effects of negative primes relative to state-oriented individuals (Studies 1–3). Action versus state orientation did not moderate affective priming effects of positive prime words (Studies 1–3). Effects of action versus state orientation emerged only for a limited number of trials (Study 2) and were reversed under low-demanding conditions (Study 3). These findings support the notion that implicit emotion regulation is closely linked to volitional action control.},

Infant massage is a developmentally supportive intervention that has been documented for several decades to have a positive effect on both full term and preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to assess the short and long term benefits of massage on stable preterm infants. Methods: A quasi experimental design was used, 66 infants were recruited from two university hospitals with tertiary level NICUs; 32 infants received the massage therapy by their mothers. Data collection by a researcher blind to the infants' group assignments included weight at discharge, pain responses on the PIPP scale at discharge, length of stay in hospital, neuro-developmental outcome (Bayley scores) and breastfeeding duration at 12 months corrected age. Results: Infants who were massaged had significantly lower scores on the PIPP after a heel-stick compared to before the massage and had lower PIPP scores at discharge compared to the control group. Massaged infants had higher cognitive scores at 12 months corrected age. Weight gain, length of stay, breastfeeding duration and motor scores did not differ between groups. Conclusion: Stable preterm infants benefit from massage therapy given by their mothers and may be a culturally acceptable form of intervention to improve the outcomes of preterm infants. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The control of physiological arousal can assist in the regulation of emotional state. A subset cortical and subcortical brain regions are implicated in autonomic control of bodily arousal during emotional behaviors. Here, we combined human functional neuroimaging with autonomic monitoring to identify neural mechanisms that support the volitional regulation of heart rate, a process that may be assisted by visual feedback. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 15 healthy adults performed an experimental task in which they were prompted voluntarily to increase or decrease cardiovascular arousal (heart rate) during true, false, or absent visual feedback. Participants achieved appropriate changes in heart rate, without significant modulation of respiratory rate, and were overall not influenced by the presence of visual feedback. Increased activity in right amygdala, striatum and brainstem occurred when participants attempted to increase heart rate. In contrast, activation of ventrolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices occurred when attempting to decrease heart rate. Biofeedback enhanced activity within occipito-temporal cortices, but there was no significant interaction with task conditions. Activity in regions including pregenual anterior cingulate and ventral striatum reflected the magnitude of successful task performance, which was negatively related to subclinical anxiety symptoms. Measured changes in respiration correlated with posterior insula activation and heart rate, at a more lenient threshold, change correlated with insula, caudate, and midbrain activity. Our findings highlight a set of brain regions, notably ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, supporting volitional control of cardiovascular arousal. These data are relevant to understanding neural substrates supporting interaction between intentional and interoceptive states related to anxiety, with implications for biofeedback interventions, e.g., real-time fMRI, that target emotional regulation.},

abstract = {Maintenance of relationship quality requires self-regulation of emotion and social behavior, and women often display greater effort in this regard than do men. Furthermore, such efforts can deplete the limited capacity for self-regulation. In recent models of self-regulation, resting level of respiratory sinus arrhythmia, quantified as high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), is an indicator of self-regulatory capacity, whereas transient increases in HF-HRV reflect self-regulatory effort. To test these hypotheses in marriage, 114 young couples completed measures of marital quality and a positive, neutral, or negative initial marital task, preceded and followed by resting baseline assessments of HF-HRV. Couples then discussed a current marital disagreement. Resting HF-HRV was correlated with marital quality, suggesting that capacity for self-regulation is associated with adaptive functioning in close relationships. For women but not men, the negative initial task produced a decrease in resting HF-HRV. This effect was mediated by the husbands' negative affect response to the task and their ratings of wives as controlling and directive. When the subsequent disagreement discussion followed the negative initial task, women displayed increased HF-HRV during the discussion but a decrease when it followed the neutral or positive task. The valence of the initial task had no effect on men's HF-HRV during disagreement. Negative marital interactions can reduce women's resting HF-HRV, with potentially adverse health consequences. Women's reduced health benefit from marriage might reflect the depleting effects on self-regulatory capacity of their greater efforts to manage relationship quality.},

The findings suggest an individually-sensitive, positive linear relationship between the arousing quality of visual stimuli and activation in amygdala and ventral visual cortex, supporting the hypothesized functional connectivity described in the animal model. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The polyvagal theory introduced a new perspective relating autonomic function to behavior, that included an appreciation of the autonomic nervous system as a "system," the identification of neural circuits involved in the regulation of autonomic state, and an interpretation of autonomic reactivity as adaptive within the context of the phylogeny of the vertebrate autonomic nervous system. The paper has two objectives: first, to provide an explicit statement of the theory; and second, to introduce the features of a polyvagal perspective. The polyvagal perspective emphasizes how an understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms and phylogenetic shifts in neural regulation leads to different questions, paradigms, explanations, and conclusions regarding autonomic function in biobehavioral processes than peripheral models. Foremost, the polyvagal perspective emphasizes the importance of phylogenetic changes in the neural structures regulating the autonomic nervous system and how these phylogenetic shifts provide insights into the adaptive function and the neural regulation of the two vagal systems. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Interoception refers to the signaling of internal bodily commands. Here, we explore repetition suppression of intero-and exteroceptive neural markers to test whether the perception and predictability of exteroceptive stimulus material affects their expression. Participants completed a repetition suppression paradigm in which angry or neutral facial expressions repeated or alternated. Participants received either an implicit (experiment 1) or explicit (experiment 2) cue enabling the formation of expectations regarding the upcoming facial expression. We measured the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) indexing cardiac processing and visual evoked potentials (VEP) in response to viewing the second (repeated or alternated) face. Repeating angry facial expressions produced repetition suppression of both HEP and VEP amplitude while repeating neutral expressions led to repetition enhancement of HEP amplitude. This effect was magnified when participants were explicitly aware of predictive cues. Furthermore, repetition suppression of HEP amplitude correlated with neural attenuation of VEP activity. Results highlight repetition effects for interoceptive as well as exteroceptive neural markers and support top-down, expectation-based accounts of the phenomenon. Furthermore, results demonstrate that the perception of exteroceptive stimulus information has an effect on the processing of interoceptive signals and suggest a direct neural connection between the processing of external and internal sensory information. Interoception refers to the processing (signaling) of homeostatic commands sent to monitor the body's internal physiological state 1 . The largely subconscious processing of internal visceral signals is regarded as a fundamental basis for the construction of an embodied sense of self, promoting affect regulation and successful interaction with the external environment 2–5 . Recently, there has been a resurgence of scientific interest in interoception partly based on its wide-ranging implications for understanding and treating conditions such as Schizophrenia 6 and depersonalization-derealisation disorder 7 and its relevance for promoting immersive experiences in virtual reality settings used to treat chronic pain 8 . Existing studies have largely explored interoception by focussing on heartbeat perception 9 as a means to quantify internal awareness. EEG studies exploring internal awareness have linked the signaling of cardiac signals to a specific ERP component manifesting with a fronto-central distri-bution around 200 to 400 ms following the R-wave in the electrocardiogram 10–13 . Increased amplitude of the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) has been shown to coincide with increased heartrate detection accuracy 14,15 . Furthermore, source modelling of the component has indicated its origin in the right insula and anterior cingu-late cortex 11 , brain structures strongly linked to interoceptive signaling 13 . To this effect, recent work by Park and colleagues 16 demonstrated that experimentally manipulating participants' sense of self-identification coincided with modulated HEP expression in the insula, thereby extending evidence for the component's link to cognitive processes involving self-consciousness. Past work thus implicates HEP amplitude as a promising neural signal to measure the signaling of interoceptive commands in the form of cardiac activity. This has led to its use in studies},

abstract = {Is the self already relational in its very bodily foundations? The question of whether our mental life is initially and primarily shaped by embodied dimensions of the individual or by interpersonal relations is debated in many fields, including psychology, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and more recently, cognitive neuroscience. In this interdisciplinary target article, we put forward the radical claim that even some of the most minimal aspects of selfhood, namely the feeling qualities associated with being an embodied subject, are fundamentally shaped by embodied interactions with other people in early infancy and beyond. Such embodied interactions allow the developing organism to mentalize its homeostatic regulation. In other words, embodied interactions contribute directly to the building of mental models of the infant's physiological states, given the need to maintain such states within a given dynamic range despite internal or external perturbations. Specifically, our position rests on the following three propositions: (1) the progressive integration and organization of sensory and motor signals constitutes the foundations of the minimal self, a process which we have linked to contemporary, computational models of brain function and named "embodied mentalization"; (2) interactions with other people are motivated and constrained by the same principles that govern the "mentalization" of sensorimotor signals in the individual-and hence the mentalization of one's body can include signals from other bodies in physical proximity and interaction, especially in interaction with particular bodies. (3) Crucially, given the dependency of humans in early infancy, there is a "homeostatically necessary" plethora of such embodied "proximal" interactions, especially as regards interoception. Collectively, such experiences of proximal intercorporeality "sculpt" the mentalization process and hence the constitution of the minimal self, including the progressive sophistication of mental distinctions between "subject-object," "self-other" and even "pleasure-pain." Finally, we explore notions of cardiac and more broadly interoceptive awareness as later, cognitive acquisitions that allow us to progressively solidify such distinctions, as well as understand and empathise with other people.},

annote = {pre and post biof training one should measure subjective perception of self-control/biofeedback skills (discrimination and self-maintanence) and strategies

The existing literature presents contradictory theories about the
effects of biofeedback: it is either attributed to volitional control over the biological variables (involving executive function) or to autonomic regulation of subcognitive systems. 

cognitive and infra-cognitive model - more visible in neurofeedback studies

a recent manuscript suggested that neurofeed- back relies on a top-down processing mechanism, where higher cognitive functions percolate down from large-scale oscillations to small-scale and single-neuronal activities (Bagdasaryan and Le Van Quyen, 2013)

dual process theory (Wood, 2014): into two main types of processing: more automatic and capacity- free processes vs. more controlled and capacity-limited processes.

Connectionist model: postulate the existence of interactions between these two types of process- ing. From this perspective, biofeedback could be considered as a self-investigation tool, where the patient improves his volitional control over autonomic mechanisms (Zolten, 1989).

Definitions:
discrimination: perception of the target biological
self-maintanance: action over the biological variable variable
Successful training: in either or both of these skills would lead to improved balance in the biologi- cal variable for patients suffering from medical conditions involving that variable, and the positive effect should remain when the feed- back is turned off (otherwise the patient would be dependent upon the feedback system).

OC {\&} Reenforcement Learning
RL can be model based or model free (only associations)
model based: subject knows that she is learning(seeks a goal)
model free: implicit learning
problem -{\textgreater} : interpretation of the signal would depend upon the motivational state of the subject 

one can look at biofeedback from an aspect of schematas, different types of memory models,.. for summary of keypoint see table 1 pg 905. 

external feedback is important

best model which bridge the grasp of amon BIOMEDICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, NEUROSCIENTIFIC, and BIOENGINEERING perspectives.

An efficient biofeedback system controls for: PERCEPTIBILITY, AUTONOMY, MASTERY, MOTIVATION, LEARNABILITY

definitions:
Perceptibility: the potential for the subject to access the perception of the biosignal he/she has to regulate. 
Autonomy: the potential for the subject to regulate the biosignal by himself, without the help of biofeedback, once the training protocol is over. 
Mastery: the degree of control the subject can exercise over the biosignal. 
Motivation: the reward system of the biofeedback device—the reinforcement signal that will induce learning. 
Learnability: the conditions for achieving long-term memory formation (e.g., sufficient amount of time and repetitions) and to the possibility of learning itself.

Develpoing a general feedback learning experience scale involving the main items of all five properties may provide us with a new and useful direction in biofeedback research.

to improve perceptibility in explicit models: provide multimodal feedbacks (Lotte et al., 2013): each sensory modal- ity would correspond to a different slave subsystem of working memory. Consequently, a sensory modality not involved in the task should be preferred in the feedback design.

Perceptibility is analougous with cognitive load - be measured using scales such as the NASA TLX (Hart and Staveland, 1988) while the subject performs the feedback learning task.

one must demonstrate that the (bio)signal is indeed correlated with biosignal regulation.

Finally, evaluating internal feedback is an observability issue:
without the presence of internal feedback there is nothing to be learned. This evaluation can be achieved using psychophysiological scales measuring perception of the internal biosignal: subjects with a complete infirmity in the trained biosignal regulation would not be good candidates for a neurofeedback procedure (since they will never be able to develop autonomy, as explained in the next section). 

Inter-individual differ- ences in the ability to monitor interoceptive signals, to concentrate on one's own internal representations and inhibit external, task- irrelevant, stimulation, should be tracked (Inter-individual differ- ences in the ability to monitor interoceptive signals, to concentrate on one's own internal representations and inhibit external, task- irrelevant, stimulation, should be tracked (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Burgess et al., 2007).

solution to achive progressive difficulty: to estimate a psy-chophysiological curve of subject performance during a calibration
phase.

A sense of fluency can be measured using scales such as SCS
(Dong et al., 2015) or equivalent standardized measures. Task per- formance (such as biosignal modulation ability) or cognitive load physiological markers (such as galvanic skin response, or CNV in Cz) are objective but indirect indicator of mastery, and should follow a U-shaped evolution (Pauls et al., 2013; Siegler, 2004; Gevensleben et al., 2014) in explicit feedback protocols. most studies investigate performances before and after feedback administration, instead of during – and are therefore ignoring this issue. Note how- ever that this U-shaped evolution might not be observed in implicit reward feedback systems, as the subject is not focusing his atten- tion directly onto the feedback.


items from standardized flow-state evaluation
scales such as the FSSOT (Yoshida et al., 2013) or equivalent stan-dardized measures.

Important criteria for participant inclusion: Learnibility - ptp have to be able to control their biosignal at least for some extent - otherwise they won't be able to learn it at all Screening is necesarry therefore: by determining the subject's fluency with- out feedback before training begins, which can be measured using scales such as the SCS (Dong et al., 2015).

definition of performance in biofeedback training: neurofeedback is usually defined as the ability to up-regulate the targeted neuromarker during feedback training sessions (Escolano et al., 2012; Witte et al., 2013; Zoefel et al., 2011; Reichert et al., 2015; Escolano et al., 2011).

For other types of biofeedback, learnability could be measured
by evaluating the modulation performance of the subject during the first training sessions: a low initial performance in explicit biofeed- back (i.e. an absence of improvement, or an absence of aptitude to modulate the biosignal) would indicate poor learnability.


The
number of sessions, session duration, and time intervals between
sessions are therefore all crucial parameters of biofeedback and
neurofeedback protocols, and the long-term effects of feedback
training should be evaluated to determine training stability.

bioengineering approach:
process control theories{\textgreater}{\textgreater} biomedical engineering models was first suggested by Norbert Wiener in 1948 who introduced cybernetics to model self-regulating mechanisms (Wiener, 1948 2nd revised ed. 1961; Mindell, 2002; Ross Ashby, 1956), and was soon identified as a framework to model biofeed- back (Anliker, 1977). It is now commonly used to model systems biology (Cosentino and Bates, 2011), see more fig 9. pg 904

conrollability: the ability to control the internal state of a system from an initial state to a final state in a finite time interval (Kalman, 1960).
Observability: the current state can be determined in a finite time using only its outputs, for any possible sequence of states and control (Kalman,

Biofeedback can be explicit or implicit (Dekker and Champion,
2007; Kuikkaniemi et al., 2010; Nacke et al., 2011); we will first provide a model for explicit biofeedback (see Fig. 8). In this model, both internal and external functions are used to control the current state of the system as compared to the target state

important: Linearity Linear process control models are generally only applicable to
linear systems, and when applied to non-linear systems, defini- tions are only valid for small movements in the neighborhood of a functioning point (Trentelman et al., 2001). Physiological regula- tion is typically non-linear, and consequently, biofeedback systems need to be individually calibrated, with each user having his own functioning point depending upon both his physiology and his proficiency at regulating the biosignal of interest. Furthermore, the regulation task should also target small enough variations in performances to prevent non-linearity effects. In addition, neu- rophysiological regulation is allostatic (Sterling, 2004): the brain performs predictive regulations and retune its parameters accord- ing to changes. Therefore, experimental protocols should take into account the fact that individuals' reference point may vary over time depending on task demands and learning.

temporality:. Consequently, contin- uous feedback about transient states is usually more efficient than discrete feedback about steady-state errors, unless steady-state error perception is not readily available to subjects

precision:
by its ability to reach a zero steady-state error (Levine, 2010). ie the precision of biosignal monitoring, the subject's perfor- mance with or without feedback) should be avaluated},

During an interoceptive awareness task, self-face observation improved performance of those with initially low awareness in the Western group, but did not benefit the East Asian participants. These results suggest that the integrated, coherent experience of the body differs between East Asian and Western cultures. For Western participants, viewing one's own face may activate a bodily self-awareness which enhances processing of other bodily information, such as interoceptive signals. Instead, for East Asian individuals, the external appearance of the self may activate higher-level, social aspects of self-identity, reflecting the importance of the sociocultural construct of "face" in East Asian cultures.},

Results indicate that at 100 ms picture presentation, HTA individuals more strongly engaged their attention with and showed impaired disengagement from highly threatening pictures than LTA individuals. In addition, HTA individuals showed a stronger tendency to attentional avoidance of threat at the 200 and 500 ms picture presentation. These data provide evidence for differential patterns of anxiety-related biases in attentive processing of threat at early versus later stages of information processing. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Preejection period (PEP) is a common measure of sympathetic nervous system activation in psychophysiological research, which makes it important to measure reliably for as many participants as possible. PEP is typically calculated as the interval between the onset or peak of the electrocardiogram Q wave and the impedance cardiography B point, but the Q wave can lack clear definition and even its peak is not visible for all participants. We thus investigated the feasibility of using the electrocardiogram R wave peak (Rpeak ) instead of Q because it can be consistently identified with ease and precision. Across four samples (total N = 408), young adult participants completed a variety of minimally metabolically demanding laboratory tasks after a resting baseline. Results consistently supported a close relationship between absolute levels of the Rpeak -B interval and PEP (accounting for approximately 90{\%} of the variance at baseline and 89{\%} during task performance, on average), but for reactivity values, Rpeak -B was practically indistinguishable from PEP (accounting for over 98{\%} of the variance, on average). Given that using Rpeak rather than the onset or peak of Q saves time, eliminates potential subjectivity, and can be applied to more participants (i.e., those without a visible Q wave), findings suggest that Rpeak -B likely provides an adequate estimate of PEP when absolute levels are of interest and clearly does so for within-person changes.},

However, deliberate emotion regulation can have significant costs for the individual. Are there less costly ways to achieve emotion regulatory goals? In two studies, we test the hypothesis that more automatic types of emotion regulation might provide the benefits of deliberate emotion regulation without the costs. Study 1 introduces a priming technique that manipulates automatic emotion regulation. Using this priming technique, we show that relative to priming emotion expression, priming emotion control leads to less anger experience in response to a laboratory anger provocation. Study 2 examines the experiential and physiological consequences of automatic emotion regulation. Results suggest that relative to priming emotion expression, priming emotion control reduces negative emotion experience without maladaptive cardiovascular responding. Together, these findings suggest that automatic emotion regulation may provide an effective means of controlling powerful negative emotions.},

Thus, people might feel different levels of emotional and moral conflict depending on the target of the deception. Here we explored, in a morally relevant setting, how social judgements based on two fundamental dimensions of human social cognition – ‘warmth' and ‘competence' – impact on the decision to deceive others. Results revealed independent effects for warmth and competence. Specifically, while people are less inclined to deceive for self-gain those individuals they perceive as warm, they also tend to lie more to highly competent others. Furthermore, the perceived warmth and competence modulated the general tendency to reduce deceptive behaviour when there was a risk of disclosure compared to when the lying was anonymous, highlighting the importance of these judgements in social evaluation processes. Together, our results demonstrate that the emotional costs and personal moral standards that inhibit engagement in deceptive behaviour are not stable but rather malleable according to the target and the consequences of the deception.},

Since heartbeat perception can be improved using appropriate training procedures, increased ability to perceive cardiac performance should also influence heartbeat-related potentials. In the present study, subjects in either of two groups had to press a button immediately after the occurrence of a heartbeat-feedback tone. Whereas the first group was given acoustical heartbeat-feedback throughout the entire training, the second group was provided with tone signals that became fainter during the course of the training phases. The better posttraining performance in heartbeat perception of the group receiving full-intensity feedback was also reflected in the evoked potentials. They differed markedly before and after training, especially between 250 to 400 ms (after the EKG-R-wave), the biggest effect being at Fz and F7. The findings are interpreted as the brain electrical reflection of an increased perception susceptibility to a cardiovascular signal occurring at about 200 ms after the R-wave.},

The extent of functional activation was larger in the right than the left hemisphere and larger in the occipital than in the occipitoparietal regions during processing of all picture contents compared with the interpicture intervals. More importantly, functional activity was significantly greater in all sampled brain regions when processing emotional (pleasant or unpleasant) pictures than when processing neutral stimuli. In Experiment 2, a hypothesis that these differences were an artifact of differential eye movements was ruled out. Whereas both emotional and neutral pictures produced activity centered on the calcarine fissure (Area 17), only emotional pictures also produced sizable clusters bilaterally in the occipital gyrus, in the right fusiform gyrus, and in the right inferior and superior parietal lobules.},

Ninety-four participants were randomized to one of three groups. The Reappraisal group was instructed to think about what they saw in a way that minimized negative emotional reactions, the Acceptance group was told to let their feelings come and go without trying to control or avoid them, while the Watch (control) group was told just to watch the film-clips. Compared to the control condition, both reappraisal and acceptance led to significant reductions of subjective distress, physiological reactions associated with aversive emotions and behavioral avoidance. On the three types of measures there were few significant differences between the Reappraisal and Acceptance groups, but when such differences existed they were to the benefit of the Reappraisal condition. In the reappraisal condition there was however a positive correlation between elicited aversive emotion and avoidance, while no such correlation existed in the acceptance condition. The results are interpreted and discussed in relation to the theories underlying reappraisal and acceptance as well as the conceptual framework for emotion regulation established by Gross (2007). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The complexity, nonlinearity and nonstationarity of the cardiovascular system typically defy comprehensive and deterministic mathematical modeling, except from a statistical perspective. Living systems are governed by numerous, continuously changing, interacting variables in the presence of noise. Cardiovascular signals can be shown to be discontinuous alternations between deter-ministic trajectories and stochastic pauses (terminal dynamics). One promising approach for assessing such nondeterministic com-plexity is recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). As reviewed in this paper, strategies implementing quantification of recurrences have been successful in diagnosing changes in nonstationary cardiac signals not easily detected by traditional methods. It is con-cluded that recurrence quantification analysis is a powerful discriminatory tool which, when properly applied to cardiac signals, can provide objectivity regarding the degree of determinism characterizing the system, state changes, as well as degrees of com-plexity and/or randomness.},

abstract = {Identifying with a body is central to being a conscious self. The now classic "rubber hand illusion" demonstrates that the experience of body-ownership can be modulated by manipulating the timing of exteroceptive (visual and tactile) body-related feedback. Moreover, the strength of this modulation is related to individual differences in sensitivity to internal bodily signals (interoception). However the interaction of exteroceptive and interoceptive signals in determining the experience of body-ownership within an individual remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that this depends on the online integration of exteroceptive and interoceptive signals by implementing an innovative "cardiac rubber hand illusion" that combined computer-generated augmented-reality with feedback of interoceptive (cardiac) information. We show that both subjective and objective measures of virtual-hand ownership are enhanced by cardio-visual feedback in-time with the actual heartbeat, as compared to asynchronous feedback. We further show that these measures correlate with individual differences in interoceptive sensitivity, and are also modulated by the integration of proprioceptive signals instantiated using real-time visual remapping of finger movements to the virtual hand. Our results demonstrate that interoceptive signals directly influence the experience of body ownership via multisensory integration, and they lend support to models of conscious selfhood based on interoceptive predictive coding. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Research in this area has developed several valid methods for measuring and manipulating implicit emotion.

However, existent evidence for this conclusion mostly relies on conscious, deliberate reappraisal that comes with the cost of cognitive efforts. The aim of the present study was to compare emotion regulation effects of conscious and unconscious reappraisal, which has been shown to be less costly in previous studies. Subjects randomly assigned to an unconscious reappraisal, conscious reappraisal, and control condition performed a frustrating arithmetic task. Subjective emotional experience and heart-rate reactivity were recorded. Participants primed with unconscious reappraisal showed the same decrease in heart-rate reactivity as those explicitly instructed to reappraise. In addition, the unconscious reappraisal group did not show reductions in subjective negative emotion, whereas this was significantly decreased in the conscious reappraisal group. Heart-rate reactivity was positively correlated with negative emotion ratings and negatively correlated with the positive emotion ratings. These results suggest that unconscious reappraisal is only effective in decreasing physiological consequences of frustrating emotion, but not in reducing subjective experience.},

abstract = {Questions surrounding physiological interdependence in romantic relationships are gaining increased attention in the research literature. One specific form of interdependence, coregulation, can be defined as the bidirectional linkage of oscillating signals within optimal bounds. Conceptual and theoretical work suggests that physiological coregulation should be instantiated in romantic couples. Although these ideas are appealing, the central tenets of most coregulatory models await empirical evaluation. In the current study, we evaluate the covariation of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in 32 romantic couples during a series of laboratory tasks using a cross-lagged panel model. During the tasks, men's and women's RSA were associated with their partners' previous RSA responses, and this pattern was stronger for those couples with higher relationship satisfaction. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for attachment theory, as well as the association between relationships and health.

abstract = {Emotion dysregulation is thought to be critical to the development of negative psychological outcomes. Gross (1998b) conceptualized the timing of regulation strategies as key to this relationship, with response-focused strategies, such as expressive suppression, as less effective and more detrimental compared to antecedent-focused ones, such as cognitive reappraisal. In the current study, we examined the relationship between reappraisal and expressive suppression and measures of psychopathology, particularly for stress-related reactions, in both undergraduate and trauma-exposed community samples of women. Generally, expressive suppression was associated with higher, and reappraisal with lower, self-reported stress-related symptoms. In particular, expressive suppression was associated with PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms in the trauma-exposed community sample, with rumination partially mediating this association. Finally, based on factor analysis, expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal appear to be independent constructs. Overall, expressive suppression, much more so than cognitive reappraisal, may play an important role in the experience of stress-related symptoms. Further, given their independence, there are potentially relevant clinical implications, as interventions that shift one of these emotion regulation strategies may not lead to changes in the other.},

However, very little is known about how trust modulates the affective link between individuals. We show here that trust has an effect on heart rate arousal and synchrony, a result consistent with research on joint action and experimental economics. We engaged participants in a series of joint action tasks which, for one group of participants, was interleaved with a PGG, and measured their heart synchrony and arousal. We found that the introduction of the economic game shifted participants' attention to the dynamics of the interaction. This was followed by increased arousal and synchrony of heart rate profiles. Also, the degree of heart rate synchrony was predictive of participants' expectations regarding their partners in the economic game. We conclude that the above changes in physiology and behavior are shaped by the valuation of other people's social behavior, and ultimately indicate trust building process.},

abstract = {Between-partner physiological linkage can be in-phase (changes in unison), or anti-phase (changes in opposite directions). In the context of conversation we predicted that in-phase linkage would occur when partners exert strong influence on each other; anti-phase linkage would occur due to the behavioral coordination of turn taking. To test this, blood pressure, inter-beat interval, and skin conductance were recorded from 44 heterosexual couples while they discussed how they influence each other's health-related behaviors. Partner influence was assessed in two ways: 1) partners' global perceptions of how they try to influence each other's health; and 2) behavioral manifestations of influence, specifically demand-withdraw behavior. As predicted, both measures of partner influence moderated physiological linkage of blood pressure such that at low levels of influence linkage was "anti-phase" and at high levels linkage was "in-phase." Several alternative hypotheses were ruled out; the effects were not due to relationship conflict, emotional experience, or simply the pattern of blood pressure over time. These results suggest that partner influence may be driving physiological linkage, which may be one avenue through which partners can affect each other's health. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Results from both studies showed that, relative to emotionally neutral speech, anger evoked an increase in articulation rate and in mean fundamental frequency (F0) and F0-range, whereas sadness evoked an increase in F0-perturbation. Both F0 and F0-range were larger for anger than for sadness. In addition, results from the mood-induction-procedure study revealed 2 Emotion ϫ Order interactions. Whereas variations in amplitude range suggested that anger evoked less physiological activation when induced after sadness, variations in F0-perturbation suggested that sadness evoked more physiological activation when induced after anger.

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

On both days, heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) and cardiac and autonomic nervous system activation indices (heart rate, normalized low frequency heart rate variability [nLF HRV]) were assessed. The HEP is an EEG pattern that is considered an index of cortical representation of afferent cardiovascular signals. Average HEP activity (R wave +455–595 ms) was enhanced during food deprivation compared to normal food intake. Cardiac activation did not differ between nutritional conditions. Our results indicate that short-term food deprivation amplifies an electrophysiological correlate of the cortical representation of visceral-afferent signals originating from the cardiovascular system.

abstract = {Research in emotion regulation has largely focused on how people manage their own emotions, but there is a growing recognition that the ways in which we regulate the emotions of others also are important. Drawing on work from diverse disciplines, we propose an integrative model of the psychological and neural processes supporting the social regulation of emotion. This orga-nizing framework, the 'social regulatory cycle', specifies at multiple levels of description the act of regulating another person's emotions as well as the experience of being a target of regulation. The cycle describes the processing stages that lead regulators to attempt to change the emotions of a target person, the impact of regulation on the processes that generate emotions in the target, and the underlying neural systems. Beyond the Individual: The Social Regulation of Emotion Whether we are angry about a disagreement at work, struggling after a breakup, or saddened by the loss of a loved one, the ability to regulate our emotions is essential for maintaining mental health, social functioning, and physical well-being. The past twenty years have seen enormous growth in research on emotion regulation [1]. For the most part this work has focused on the ability of an individual to self-regulate their emotions. Experiments have examined how specific regulatory strategies relate to behavioral, experiential, and physiological outcomes [2]. Neuro-imaging studies focusing primarily on cognitive means of controlling emotion have shown that effective regulation is supported by prefrontal systems that modulate activity in largely subcorti-cal systems that generate emotions [3]. In addition, multilevel models [4] have been proposed that describe links between the use of specific strategies, supporting cognitive and affective processes, and the underlying neural systems. As significant as these empirical and theoretical advances have been, there is growing recogni-tion that understanding how people regulate each other's emotions is important as well. The social regulation of emotion refers to one individual (the regulator) deliberately attempting to change the emotional response of another individual (the target), and several literatures have examined social regulatory phenomena. Developmental research has examined the socialization of emotions in children, highlighting that social regulation not only improves the current emotional state of the child but also enhances their capacity to self-regulate in the future [5,6]. Social and clinical studies of romantic couples emphasize the bidirectional nature of emotional expression and experience, embedding both target and regulator in a continuous exchange where both mutually shape one another's outcomes [7]. Organizational behavior research underscores the relational benefits of social emotion regulation, particularly with respect to building trust [8–10]. In addition, research in social cognitive neuroscience provides insights into the psychological},

abstract = {Performers improvising together describe special moments of 'being in the zone' - periods of high performance, synchrony, and enhanced sense of togetherness. Existing evidence suggests a possible route for attaining togetherness - interpersonal synchrony, the fine-grained sensory-motor coordination that promotes social connectedness. Here, we investigated the physiological characteristics of togetherness using a practice from theater and dance, the mirror game. Pairs of expert improvisers jointly improvised synchronized linear motion, while their motion tracks and cardiovascular activity were continuously monitored. Players also provided dynamic ratings of togetherness while watching video recordings of their games. We identified periods of togetherness using kinematic and subjective markers and assessed their physiological characteristics. The kinematic and the subjective measures of togetherness showed some agreement, with more extensive game periods being marked by the subjective than the kinematic one. Game rounds with high rates of togetherness were characterized by increased players' cardiovascular activity, increased correlation of players' heart rates (HRs), and increased motion intensity. By comparing motion segments with similar motion intensity, we showed that moments of togetherness in the mirror game were marked by increased players' HRs, regardless of motion intensity. This pattern was robust for the subjectively defined periods of togetherness, while showing a marginal effect for the kinematically defined togetherness. Building upon similar findings in flow research we suggest that the observed increase of players' HRs during togetherness periods in the mirror game might indicate the enhanced engagement and enjoyment reported by performers going into 'the zone.' The suggested approach, combining temporal measurements of kinematic, physiological and subjective responses, demonstrates how the dynamics of spontaneously emerging dyadic states can be studied empirically.},

In this article, we demonstrate that individual differences in resting HRV predict the functioning of the inhibition of return (IOR), an inhibitory attentional mechanism highly adaptive to novelty search, in response to affectively significant face cues. As predicted, participants with lower HRV exhibited a smaller IOR effect to fearful versus neutral face cues than participants with higher HRV, which shows a failure to inhibit attention from affectively significant cues and instigate novelty search. In contrast, participants with higher HRV exhibited similar IOR effects to fearful and neutral face cues, which shows an ability to inhibit attention from cues and instigate novelty search. Their ability to inhibit attention was most pronounced to high spatial frequency fearful face cues, suggesting that this effect may be mediated by cortical mechanisms. The current research demonstrates that individual differences in HRV predict attentional inhibition and suggests that successful inhibition and novelty search may be mediated by cortical inhibitory mechanisms among people with high cardiac vagal tone.},

The current analysis of earthquakes is typically based on linear mathematical models that may fail to describe and forecast particular behaviors, because in many cases the data complexity may induce a highly non linear behavior. In this paper the implementation of an alternative method for seismic time series analysis is presented. The RPs (Recurrence Plots) enables recognition and treatment of measured accelerations. An RP obtained from seismic data allows a more efficient interpretation of the ground motions and this explanation contributes to characterize materials and responses. The nonlinear attributes from RPs analysis can be used as filters to reveal patterns or be combined to predict a seismic property. Automated seismic data characterization, based on nonlinear seismic attributes, could rewrite the rules of earthquake phenomena interpretation. The objective of this work is to establish a new methodology for practical application of nonlinear dynamics in seismic pattern/attributes recognition, an evolving and challenging engineering field.},

This positive shift began 200-300 ms after picture onset, reached its maximum amplitude ???1 s after picture onset, and was sustained for most of a 6-s picture presentation period. The positive increase was not related to local probability of content type, but was accentuated for pictures that prompted increased autonomic responses and reports of greater affective arousal (e.g. erotic or violent content). These results suggest that the late positive wave indicates a selective processing of emotional stimuli, reflecting the activation of motivational systems in the brain.

abstract = {ISSN: 0269-9931 (Print) 1464-0600 (Online) Journal homepage: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/pcem20 Past research has established that people can strategically enhance or override impulsive emotional behaviour with implementation intentions (Eder, Rothermund, {\&} Proctor, 2010). However, it is unclear whether emotional action tendencies change by intentional processes or by habit formation processes due to repeated enactment of the intention (or both). The present study shows that forming implementation intentions is sufficient to modulate emotional action tendencies. Participants received instructions about how to respond to positive and negative stimuli on evaluation trials but no such trials were actually presented. Results showed that merely intending to approach and avoid affective stimuli influenced emotional action tendencies in a modified affective Simon task in which affective valence was irrelevant. An affective Simon effect (i.e., faster reactions when the valence of the stimulus corresponded with the valence of the movement) was observed when participants intended evaluations with affectively congruent responses (i.e., positive{\'{A}}approach, negative{\'{A}}avoid); in contrast, the effect was reversed in direction when participants planned evaluations with incongruent responses (i.e., positive{\'{A}}avoid, negative{\'{A}}approach). Thus, implementa-tion intentions can regulate implicit emotional responses even in the absence of possible habit formation processes. Implications for dual-system accounts of emotion regulation are discussed.},

anger was the only emotion to show a significant increase in sympathetic activity, accompanied by a significant

Here we report an inverse association between aging and interoception, as indexed by the ability to sense the heartbeat at rest. In a group of 59 participants ranging in age from 22 to 63 years, age inversely predicted heartbeat detection ability, both within and across several measurement sessions. On average, age accounted for 30{\%} of the variance in heartbeat detection accuracy. Other attribute variables including body mass index and sex were not related to heartbeat detection ability. These findings provide clear empirical evidence that interoception, much like exteroception and proprioception, declines with age.},

abstract = {We investigated how motor agency in the voluntary control of body movement influences body awareness. In the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI), synchronous tactile stimulation of a rubber hand and the participant's hand leads to a feeling of the rubber hand being incorporated in the participant's own body. One quantifiable behavioural correlate of the illusion is an induced shift in the perceived location of the participant's hand towards the rubber hand. Previous studies showed that the induced changes in body awareness are local and fragmented: the proprioceptive drift is largely restricted to the stimulated finger. In the present study, we investigated whether active and passive movements, rather than tactile stimulation, would lead to similarly fragmented body awareness. Participants watched a projected image of their hand under three conditions: active finger movement, passive finger movement, and tactile stimulation. Visual feedback was either synchronous or asynchronous with respect to stimulation of the hand. A significant overall RHI, defined as greater drifts following synchronous than asynchronous stimulation, was found in all cases. However, the distribution of the RHI across stimulated and non-stimulated fingers depended on the kind of stimulation. Localised proprioceptive drifts, specific to the stimulated finger, were found for tactile and passive stimulation. Conversely, during active movement of a single digit, the proprioceptive drifts were not localised to that digit, but were spread across the whole hand. Whereas a purely proprioceptive sense of body-ownership is local and fragmented, the motor sense of agency integrates distinct body-parts into a coherent, unified awareness of the body.},

We predicted that nondepressed persons who cried would show elevations in RSA during the onset and the resolution of crying. By contrast, we predicted that depressed individuals who cried would fail to exhibit increased RSA over the course of their crying episodes. As hypothesized, nondepressed participants exhibited RSA increases that accompanied the resolution of tearful crying, consistent with a homeostatic function for crying, whereas depressed subjects who cried did not exhibit increased RSA.

Interpersonal autonomic physiology is defined as the relationship between people's physiological dynamics, as indexed by
continuous measures of the autonomic nervous system. Findings from this field of study indicate that physiological activity
between two or more people can become associated or interdependent, often referred to as physiological synchrony.
Physiological synchrony has been found in both new and established relationships across a range of contexts, and it correlates
with a number of psychosocial constructs. Given these findings, interpersonal physiological interactions are theorized to be
ubiquitous social processes that co-occur with observable behavior. However, this scientific literature is fragmented, making
it difficult to evaluate consistency across reports. In an effort to facilitate more standardized scholarly approaches, this
systematic review provides a description of existing work in the area and highlights theoretical, methodological, and statistical
issues to be addressed in future interpersonal autonomic physiology research.},

Constructing autobiographical memories involves search, monitoring and self-referential processes that are associated with activity in separable prefrontal regions. The contributions of emotion and vividness have been linked to the amygdala and visual cortex respectively. Finally, there is evidence that recent and remote autobiographical memories might activate the hippocampus equally, which has implications for memory-consolidation theories.

The Rubber Hand Illusion has been used as a model instance of the normal sense of embodiment to investigate the processes that underpin the experience of body-ownership. This review puts forward a neurocognitive model according to which body-ownership arises as an interaction between current multisensory input and internal models of the body. First, a pre-existing stored model of the body distinguishes between objects that may or may not be part of one's body. Second, on-line anatomical and postural representations of the body modulate the integration of multisensory information that leads to the recalibration of visual and tactile coordinate systems. Third, the resulting referral of tactile sensation will give rise to the subjective experience of body-ownership. These processes involve a neural network comprised of the right temporoparietal junction which tests the incorporeability of the external object, the secondary somatosensory cortex which maintains an on-line representation of the body, the posterior parietal and ventral premotor cortices which code for the recalibration of the hand-centred coordinate systems, and the right posterior insula which underpins the subjective experience of body-ownership. The experience of body-ownership may represent a critical component of self-specificity as evidenced by the different ways in which multisensory integration in interaction with internal models of the body can actually manipulate important physical and psychological aspects of the self. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND
While previous epidemiological studies report adverse effects of long-term noise exposure on cardiovascular health, the mechanisms responsible for these effects are unclear. We sought to elucidate the cardiovascular and stress response to short-term, low (31.5–125Hz) and high (500–2000Hz) frequency noise exposures. 

METHODS
Healthy male (n=10) participants were monitored on multiple visits during no noise, low- or high-frequency noise exposure scenarios lasting 40min. Participants were fitted with an ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure measures and saliva samples were taken before, during and after noise exposures. ECGs were processed for measures of heart rate variability (HRV): high-frequency power (HF), low-frequency power (LF), the root of the mean squared difference between adjacent normal heart beats (N-N) intervals (RMSSD), and the standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DPB), and pulse were reported and saliva was analyzed for salivary cortisol and amylase. Multivariate mixed-effects linear regression models adjusted for age were used to identify statistically significant difference in outcomes by no noise, during noise or after noise exposure periods and whether this differed by noise frequency. 

RESULTS
A total of 658, 205, and 122, HRV, saliva, and blood pressure measurements were performed over 41 person days. Reductions in HRV (LF and RMSSD) were observed during noise exposure (a reduction of 19{\%} (-35,-3.5) and 9.1{\%} (-17,-1.1), respectively). After adjusting for noise frequency, during low frequency noise exposure, HF, LF, and SDNN were reduced (a reduction of 32{\%} (-57,-6.2), 34{\%} (-52,-15), and 16{\%} (-26,-6.1), respectively) and during high frequency noise exposure, a 21{\%} (-39,-2.3) reduction in LF, as compared to during no noise exposure, was found. No significant (p{\textless}0.05) changes in blood pressure, salivary cortisol, or amylase were observed. 

CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that exposure to noise, and in particular, to low-frequency noise, negatively impacts HRV. The frequencies of noise should be considered when evaluating the cardiovascular health impacts of exposure.},

The perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes that enable individuals to coordinate their actions with others have been receiving increasing attention during the last decade, complement- ing earlier work on shared intentionality and discourse. This chapter reviews current theoretical concepts and empirical findings in order to provide a structured overview of the state of the art in joint action research. We distin- guish between planned and emergent coordination. In planned coordination, agents' behavior is driven by representations that specify the desired outcomes of joint action and the agent's own part in achieving these outcomes. In emergent coordination, coordinated behavior occurs due to perception–action couplings that make multiple individuals act in similar ways, independently of joint plans. We review evidence for the two types of coordination and discuss potential synergies between them.},

abstract = {Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms, but PTSD's effects on the autonomic stress response and the potential influence of HRV biofeedback in stress relaxation training on improving PTSD symptoms are not well understood. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of a predeployment stress inoculation training (PRESTINT) protocol on physiologic measures of HRV in a large sample of the military population randomly assigned to experimental HRV biofeedback-assisted relaxation training versus a control condition. PRESTINT altered the parasympathetic regulation of cardiac activity, with experimental subjects exhibiting greater HRV, that is, less arousal, during a posttraining combat simulation designed to heighten arousal. Autonomic reactivity was also found to be related to PTSD and self-reported use of mental health services. Future PRESTINT training could be appropriate for efficiently teaching self-help skills to reduce the psychological harm following trauma exposure by increasing the capacity for parasympathetically modulated reactions to stress and providing a coping tool (i.e., relaxation method) for use following a stressful situation.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Cognitive emotion regulation is a powerful way of modulating emotional responses. However, despite the vital role of emotions in learning, it is unknown whether the effect of cognitive emotion regulation also extends to the modulation of learning. Computational models indicate prediction error activity, typically observed in the striatum and ventral tegmental area, as a critical neural mechanism involved in associative learning. We used model-based fMRI during aversive conditioning with and without cognitive emotion regulation to test the hypothesis that emotion regulation would affect prediction error-related neural activity in the striatum and ventral tegmental area, reflecting an emotion regulation-related modulation of learning. Our results show that cognitive emotion regulation reduced emotion-related brain activity, but increased prediction error-related activity in a network involving ventral tegmental area, hippocampus, insula and ventral striatum. While the re-duction of response activity was related to behavioral measures of emotion regulation success, the enhancement of prediction error-related neural activity was related to learning performance. Furthermore, functional connec-tivity between the ventral tegmental area and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, an area involved in regulation, was specifically increased during emotion regulation and likewise related to learning performance. Our data, therefore, provide first-time evidence that beyond reducing emotional responses, cognitive emotion regulation affects learning by enhancing prediction error-related activity, potentially via tegmental dopaminergic pathways.},

The model included parameters representing self-regulation and coregulation for each individual in the dyad. We applied the model directly to each dyad's data and then examined the distributions of the parameters, and compared such parameters across the three laboratory tasks.

abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complimentary to this, many scientists have realized the need for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired 'inference at a glance' nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These "raincloud plots" can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab (https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots). Readers can investigate the R and Python tutorials interactively in the browser using Binder by Project Jupyter. Introduction Effective data visualization is key to the interpretation and communication of data analysis. Ideally a statistical plot or data graphic should balance functionality, interpretability, and complexity, all without needlessly sacrificing aesthetics. That is to say, the perfect visualization is one which uses as little 'ink' as possible to capture exactly the desired statistical inference in an intuitive and appealing format (Tufte, 1983). As},

abstract = {As a social species, humans evolved to detect information from the social behavior of others. Yet, the mechanisms used to evaluate social interactions, the brain networks implicated in such recognition, and whether individual differences in own social behavior determine response to similar behavior in others remain unknown. Here we examined social synchrony as a potentially important mechanism in the evaluation of social behavior and utilized the parenting context, an evolutionarily salient setting of significant consequences for infant survival, to test this issue. The brain response of healthy postpartum mothers to three mother-infant interaction vignettes was assessed. Videos included a typical synchronous interaction and two pathological interactions of mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression and anxiety that showed marked deviations from social synchrony. Mothers' own interactions with their 4- to 6-month-old infants were videotaped and micro-coded for synchrony. Results indicated that the recognition of social synchrony involved activations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), fusiform, cuneus, inferior parietal lobule, supplementary motor area and NAcc. Mother's own synchrony with her infant correlated with her dACC response to synchrony in others. Findings are consistent with models suggesting that social action underpins social recognition and highlight social synchrony and the mother-infant bond as one prototypical context for studying the brain basis of social understanding.},

abstract = {Biofeedback training is an efficient means to gain control over a physiological function typically considered involuntary. Accordingly, learning to self-regulate nociceptive physiological activity may improve pain control by activating endogenous modulatory processes. The aim of the present study was to assess whether trial-by-trial visual feedback of nociceptive flexion reflex (RIII-reflex) responses (an index of spinal nociception) evoked by brief painful shocks applied to the sural nerve could be beneficial to guide participants in adopting strategies aiming at modulating pain perception. In order to determine specific changes induced by biofeedback, the modulation of RIII-reflex amplitude and pain ratings was compared following instructions to increase or decrease RIII-reflex amplitude in three groups, including a biofeedback group receiving a visual signal corresponding to the RIII-reflex amplitude (valid feedback), a sham biofeedback group (similar but invalid feedback), and a control group receiving no feedback. Results indicate that participants in all three groups could gain control over RIII-reflex (p{\textless}0.001), resulting in the modulation of pain intensity (p{\textless}0.001) and pain unpleasantness (p{\textless}0.001). The biofeedback group was not significantly superior to the sham and the control groups in the modulation of RIII-reflex amplitude, pain intensity or unpleasantness. These results are consistent with the notion that RIII-reflex amplitude and pain perception can be modulated voluntarily by various cognitive strategies. However, immediate retrospective visual feedback of acute nociceptive responses presented iteratively in successive trials may not improve the efficacy of these self-regulation processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 IBRO.},

Each of these issueswas examined in the context of the error-related negativity and the lateralized readiness potential.We found that doubling the number of trials recom- mended by previous studies led to more than a doubling of statistical power under many conditions. Thus,when determining the number of trials that should be included in a given study, researchersmust consider the sample size, the anticipated effectmagnitude, and the noise level, rather than relying solely on general recommendations about the number of tri- als needed to obtain a “stable”ERPwaveform.},

abstract = {Research suggests that respiratory patterns may reflect general dimensions of emotional response. In this study, we investigated the relationships between judgments of affective valence (pleasantness) and arousal and respiratory responses to acoustic stimuli. Sixteen environmental noises and 16 musical fragments of 30 s duration were presented to 31 participants, while respiration, skin conductance level and heart rate were recorded. Judgments of valence and arousal were registered using the 9-point Self-Assessment Manikin. For noises, breathing accelerated and minute ventilation augmented with decreases in pleasantness for low-arousal stimuli and with increases in arousal for positive stimuli. For music, breathing accelerated and minute ventilation augmented with increases both in rated valence and arousal. Skin conductance level increased with arousal ratings for music but not for noises, whereas mean heart rate increased with rated arousal for noises but not for music. Although both noises and music are sound-vibrations, differences in the relationships between affective judgments and physiological responses were found suggesting differences in the processing of the two types of acoustic stimuli. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

abstract = {A host of theoretical frameworks suggest associations of physiological signals between two individuals within a romantic relationship. However, few studies have provided empirical evidence of such associations using physiological reactivity from both partners in the dyad. In this study we use measures of respiration and heart rate from romantic partners recorded across three laboratory tasks. We examine the interrelations of each measure between both dyad members using coupled linear oscillators (Boker {\&} Nesselroade, 2002). These models were used to capture oscillations in respiration and heart rate, and to examine interdependence in the physiological signals between both partners. Results show that associations were detectable within all three tasks, with different patterns of coupling within each task. Discussion centers on ways to investigate the synchrony of physiological responses across within relationships, including the promises of and obstacles for doing so.},

abstract = {The mind and body are intrinsically and dynamically coupled. Perceptions, thoughts and feelings change, and respond to, the state of the body. This chapter describes the integration of cognitive and affective processes with the autonomic control of bodily arousal, focusing on reciprocal effects of autonomic responses on decision making, error detection, memory and emotions. Neuroimaging techniques are beginning to detail the neuronal substrates mediating these interactions between mental and physiological states, implicating cortical regions (specifically insular and cingulate cortices) alongside subcortical (amygdala) and brainstem (notably dorsal pons) in these mechanisms. The extent to which bodily states influence mental processes is determined in part by "interoceptive sensitivity," an index of individual differences in the ability to detect one's own bodily sensations. Moreover, the misidentification or misattribution of interoceptive responses is implicated in a number of pathologies such as depersonalization, schizophrenia, and anxiety. Increasing knowledge of the mechanisms of body-mind interactions has wide ranging implications, from decision making to empathy, and may serve elucidate potential avenues of intervention for stress-sensitive conditions in which psychological, cognitive, and emotional factors impact on the expression of physical symptoms. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Minimalist accounts seek to reduce the cognitive complexity demanded by classical accounts either by leaving out shared intentions or by characterizing them in a way that does not demand common knowledge of complex, interconnected structures of intentions. Moreover, they propose models of the actual factors facilitating online coordination of movements. The present proposal aims to enrich a minimalist framework by showing how shared emotions can facilitate coordination without presupposing common knowledge of complex, interconnected structures of intentions. Shared emotions are defined for the purposes of this paper as affective states that fulfill two minimal criteria: (a) they are expressed (verbally or otherwise) by one person; and (b) the expression is perceived (consciously or unconsciously) by another person. Various ways in which the fulfillment of (a) and (b) can lead to effects that function as coordinating factors in joint action are distinguished and discussed.},

abstract = {This paper questions the need for reinforcement learning or control theory when optimising behaviour. We show that it is fairly simple to teach an agent complicated and adaptive behaviours using a free-energy formulation of perception. In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain.},

Heart period variability (HPV) and heart rate (HR) reactivity were studied in 53 males and females who were being shown pictures of angry and happy faces. The pictures, which were backwardly masked, were presented once every 30 s during a 5-min period and under three conditions (counterbalanced for type of facial expression): below the level of conscious recognition (17 ms), at an intermediate level (56 ms), and at a clearly recognizable level (2370 ms). Analyses of HR power spectrum (for 5 min in each condition) in the high frequency region (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) that reflects respiratory sinus arrhythmia, as well as analysis of phasic heart rate responses (7.5 s in 0.5 epochs following every picture presentation) were carried out. The main findings were that HF-power was higher, and cardiac midinterval acceleration lower, in response to angry as opposed to happy faces, a result obtained only for the men, however. No interaction effect between facial expression and the three exposure conditions was found, suggesting that the pictures induced emotional activation both subliminally and supraliminally. The results were discussed in terms of increased attention to aversive stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objective: Laboratory studies of emotion-induced cardiovas-cular responses have been conducted predominantly with a specific affects approach rather than a dimensional approach. The purpose of this study was to apply the principles of the Circumplex Model of Affect (i.e., valence and arousal) to investigate cardiovascular reactivity during emotional activation in men and women. Methods: Forty-two healthy university students (mean age =19.45, 52{\%} women, 58{\%} Caucasian) engaged in personally relevant recall tasks that varied as a function of valence and arousal. Self-reported valence and arousal, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), heart rate (HR), preejection period (PEP), stroke index (SI), cardiac index (CI), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were measured during baseline and task periods. Results: Cardiovascular responses were found to be largely comparable across the recall tasks and were characterized by significant increases in blood pressure, HR, and TPR, and decreases in SI (Ps {\textless} .001). In addition, SBP during negative valence tasks was significantly higher than during positive valence tasks (P {\textless} .03), and PEP lengthened more during low as compared to high arousal tasks (P {\textless} .03). Conclusions: These results highlight the similarity of hemodynamic adjustments during the verbal expression of emotion across gender and the dimensions of valence and arousal. The overall response pattern suggests a-adrenergically mediated sympathetic activation and vagal with-drawal. D},

abstract = {Abstract. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a common measure of the autonomic modulation of the heart. To ensure accuracy, various external factors known to affect HRV such as medication use and concurrent illnesses are frequently controlled during measurement. While the influences of such confounds on accurate measurement of HRV are accepted, the influence of seemingly innocuous daily activities such as drinking and eating have received remarkably little attention. In fact, water consumption is known to provoke a powerful pressor stimulus that is buffered by changes in cardiovagal outflow yet it is sporadically controlled during experimentation. This paper examines the dose-dependent magnitude of the effect of water on HRV, the loss of HRV during a common attentional task after water consumption, and the typical scenario of water and mixed meal ingestion. Our findings show that water affects HRV in a dose- dependent manner, and exaggerates attentionally-mediated HRV reduction. This effect is antagonised by simultaneous mixed meal consumption, which strongly increases cardiac sympathetic activity. Water consumption during or previous to HRV measurement should be carefully controlled, if possible. Considering the diverse nature of experimental protocols and populations, we suggest a hierarchy of methods to control for water consumption in HRV research},

abstract = {Low heart rate variability (HRV) characterizes several medical and psychological diseases. HRV bio-feedback is a newly developed approach that may have some use for treating the array of disorders in which HRV is relatively low. This review critically appraises evidence for the effectiveness of HRV and related biofeedback across 14 studies in improving (1) HRV and baroreflex outcomes and (2) clinical outcomes. Results revealed that HRV biofeedback consistently effectuates acute improve-ments during biofeedback practice, whereas the presence of short-term and long-term carry-over effects is less clear. Some evidence suggests HRV biofeedback may result in long-term carry-over effects on baroreflex gain, which is an area most promising for future investigations. On the other hand, concerning clinical outcomes, there is ample evi-dence attesting to efficacy of HRV biofeedback. However, because clinical and physiological outcomes do not improve concurrently in all cases, the mechanism by which HRV biofeedback results in salutary effects in unclear. Considerations for the field in addressing shortcomings of the reviewed studies and advancing understanding of the way in which HRV biofeedback may improve physiolog-ical and clinical outcomes are offered in light of the reviewed evidence.},

However, there is growing research interest in implicit (automatic) forms of emotion regulation. To organise emerging findings, we present a dual-process framework that integrates explicit and implicit forms of emotion regulation, and argue that both forms of regulation are necessary for well-being. In the first section of this review, we provide a broad overview of the construct of emotion regulation, with an emphasis on explicit and implicit processes. In the second section, we focus on explicit emotion regulation, considering both neural mechanisms that are associated with these processes and their experiential and physiological consequences. In the third section, we turn to several forms of implicit emotion regulation, and integrate the burgeoning literature in this area.

The two tasks differed only in the stimuli used for trial cues (i.e., circles versus facial expressions). Moderate correlations (r = .51–.56) between commission errors across the emotional and non-emotional tasks support the construct validity of behavioral inhibition. Further, parametric manipulation of preceding context had comparable effects on performance on the two tasks. Responses were slower and more variable, commission errors were more numerous, and perceptual sensitivity was lower on the emotional than the non-emotional task. A bias for happy faces on the emotional task resulted in faster responses and more commission errors for happy than sad faces despite marginally greater sensitivity for the latter. These results suggest that the basic neuropsychological constructs of the original go/no-go task were preserved in the emotional adaptation.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Human perception is invariably accompanied by a graded feeling of confidence that guides metacognitive awareness and decision-making. It is often assumed that this arises solely from the feed-forward encoding of the strength or precision of sensory inputs. In contrast, interoceptive inference models suggest that confidence reflects a weighted integration of sensory precision and expectations about internal states, such as arousal. Here we test this hypothesis using a novel psychophysical paradigm, in which unseen disgust-cues induced unexpected, unconscious arousal just before participants discriminated motion signals of variable precision. Across measures of perceptual bias, uncertainty, and physiological arousal we found that arousing disgust cues modulated the encoding of sensory noise. Furthermore, the degree to which trial-by-trial pupil fluctuations encoded this nonlinear interaction correlated with trial level confidence. Our results suggest that unexpected arousal regulates perceptual precision, such that subjective confidence reflects the integration of both external sensory and internal, embodied states.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to test whether sensory facilitation by emotional cues can also be found in the auditory domain. We recorded auditory brain activation with functional near-infrared-spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive and silent neuroimaging technique, while participants were listening to standardized pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral sounds selected from the International Affective Digitized Sound System (IADS). Pleasant and unpleasant sounds led to increased auditory cortex activation as compared to neutral sounds. This is the first study to suggest that the enhanced activation of sensory areas in response to complex emotional stimuli is apparently not restricted to the visual domain but is also evident in the auditory domain.},

To use and quantify such dynamics, one needs appropriate statistics that capture these aspects.

abstract = {Emotional trauma and psychological stress can precipitate cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death through arrhythmogenic effects of efferent sympathetic drive. Patients with preexisting heart disease are particularly at risk. Moreover, generation of proarrhythmic activ-ity patterns within cerebral autonomic centers may be amplified by afferent feedback from a dysfunctional myocardium. An electrocor-tical potential reflecting afferent cardiac information has been de-scribed, reflecting individual differences in interoceptive sensitivity (awareness of one's own heartbeats). To inform our understanding of mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenesis, we extended this ap-proach, identifying electrocortical potentials corresponding to the cortical expression of afferent information about the integrity of myocardial function during stress. We measured changes in cardiac response simultaneously with electroencephalography in patients with established ventricular dysfunction. Experimentally induced mental stress enhanced cardiovascular indices of sympathetic activity (systolic blood pressure, heart rate, ventricular ejection fraction, and skin conductance) across all patients. However, the functional re-sponse of the myocardium varied; some patients increased, whereas others decreased, cardiac output during stress. Across patients, heart-beat-evoked potential amplitude at left temporal and lateral frontal electrode locations correlated with stress-induced changes in cardiac output, consistent with an afferent cortical representation of myo-cardial function during stress. Moreover, the amplitude of the heart-beat-evoked potential in the left temporal region reflected the proar-rhythmic status of the heart (inhomogeneity of left ventricular repolarization). These observations delineate a cortical representa-tion of cardiac function predictive of proarrhythmic abnormalities in cardiac repolarization. Our findings highlight the dynamic interaction of heart and brain in stress-induced cardiovascular morbidity.},

Interocep-tion is distinct from the processing of sensory information concerning external (non-self) stimuli (e.g. vision, hearing, touch and smell) and is the afferent axis to internal (autonomic and hormonal) physiological control. However, the impact of interoception extends beyond homeostatic/allostatic reflexes: it is proposed to be fundamental to motivation, emotion (affective feelings and behaviours), social cognition and self-awareness. This view is supported by a growing body of experimental evidence that links peripheral physiological states to mental processes. Within this framework, the representation of self is constructed from early development through continuous integra-tive representation of biological data from the body, to form the basis for those aspects of conscious awareness grounded on the subjective sense of being a unique individual. This theme issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B draws together state-of-the-art knowledge concerning theoretical, experimental and clinical facets of interoception with the emphasis on cognitive and affective neuroscience.

The electroencephalography amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potential in interoceptive learners, that is, participants whose accuracy of tapping to their heartbeat improved after auditory feedback, was higher compared with non-learners. However, an increase in gamma phase synchrony (30-45 Hz) after the heartbeat auditory feedback was present only in those participants showing agreement between objective interoceptive performance and metacognitive awareness. Source localization in a group of participants and direct cortical recordings in a single patient identified a network hub for interoceptive learning in the insular cortex.

A 3 Group×2 Time mixed experimental design was employed to compare the effect of group before and after intervention on performance anxiety (STAI-S) and frequency domain measures of HRV.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Slow breathing groups (n=30) showed significantly greater improvements in high frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio measures of HRV relative to control (n=15) during 5 minute recordings of performance anticipation following the intervention (effect size: $\eta$(2) =0.122 and $\eta$(2) =0.116, respectively). The addition of biofeedback to a slow breathing protocol did not produce differential results. While intervention groups did not exhibit an overall reduction in self-reported anxiety, participants with high baseline anxiety who received the intervention (n=15) displayed greater reductions in self-reported state anxiety relative to those in the control condition (n=7) (r=0.379).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a single session of slow breathing, regardless of biofeedback, is sufficient for controlling physiological arousal in anticipation of psychosocial stress associated with music performance and that slow breathing is particularly helpful for musicians with high levels of anxiety. Future research is needed to further examine the effects of HRV BF as a low-cost, non-pharmacological treatment for music performance anxiety.},

Relative to simply viewing pictures, voluntary reappraisal to increase negative emotion generated greater facial corrugator EMG and SCR responses, and reappraisal to decrease negative emotion generated decreased corrugator EMG responses. Men showed enhanced recognition for pictures presented during the increase and decrease conditions, whereas women showed comparable recognition performance across all regulation conditions. The modulation of subsequent recognition memory associated with decreasing emotion was inversely associated with changes in physiological responses. Our results suggest that sex is an important factor to consider in determining how reappraisal-induced physiological changes are associated with subsequent changes in memory. These findings contribute to our understanding of how reappraising emotion exerts both immediate and enduring influences on physiological responses and subsequent memory. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

@article{Billman2013a,
abstract = {Power spectral analysis of the beat-to-beat variations of heart rate or the heart period (R–R interval) has become widely used to quantify cardiac autonomic regulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007; Thayler et al., 2010; Billman, 2011). This technique partitions the total variance (the “power”) of a continuous series of beats into its frequency components, typically identifying two or three main peaks: Very Low Frequency (VLF) {\textless}0.04 Hz, Low Frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz, and High Frequency (HF) 0.15–0.4 Hz. It should be noted that the HF peak is shifted to a higher range (typically 0.24–1.04 Hz) in infants and during exercise (Berntson et al., 1997). The HF peak is widely believed to reflect cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity while the LF, although more complex, is often assumed to have a dominant sympathetic component (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Billman, 2011). Based upon these assumptions, Pagani and co-workers proposed that the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) could be used to quantify the changing relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities (i.e., the sympatho-vagal balance) (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991) in both health and disease. However, this concept has been challenged (Kingwell et al., 1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2011). Despite serious and largely under-appreciated limitations, the LF/HF ratio has gained wide acceptance as a tool to assess cardiovascular autonomic regulation where increases in LF/HF are assumed to reflect a shift to “sympathetic dominance” and decreases in this index correspond to a “parasympathetic dominance.” Therefore, it is vital to provide a critical assessment of the assumptions upon which this concept is based.},

abstract = {The present study investigates the external validity of emotional value measured in economic laboratory experiments by using a physiological indicator of stress, heart rate variability (HRV). While there is ample evidence supporting the external validity of economic experiments, there is little evidence comparing the magnitude of internal levels of emotional stress during decision making with external stress. The current study addresses this gap by comparing the magnitudes of decision stress experienced in the laboratory with the stress from outside the laboratory. To quantify a large change in HRV, measures observed in the laboratory during decision-making are compared to the difference between HRV during a university exam and other mental activity for the same individuals in and outside of the laboratory. The results outside the laboratory inform about the relevance of laboratory findings in terms of their relative magnitude. Results show that psychologically induced HRV changes observed in the laboratory, particularly in connection with social preferences, correspond to large effects outside. This underscores the external validity of laboratory findings and shows the magnitude of emotional value connected to pro-social economic decisions in the laboratory. Economists increasingly rely on insights from economic laboratory experiments, using them in theoretical research and to inform policy-makers. However, while experiments are an important research tool, economists, as experimental researchers in all branches of science, are mainly interested in what happens outside the labora-tory. For this reason the external validity of laboratory results is of central importance to assess the usefulness of experiments for theory and policy-making. Loewenstein 1},

abstract = {Interoception, which refers to the perception of internal body signals, has been consistently associated with emotional processing and with the sense of self. However, its influence on the subjective appraisal of affectively neutral and body-unrelated stimuli is still largely unknown. Across two experiments we sought to investigate this issue by asking participants to detect changes in the flashing rhythm of a simple stimulus (a circle) that could either be pulsing synchronously with their own heartbeats or following the pattern of another person's heart. While overall task performance did not vary as a function of cardio-visual synchrony, participants were better at identifying trials in which no change occurred when the flashes were synchronous with their own heartbeats. This study adds to the growing body of research indicating that we use our body as a reference point when perceiving the world; and extends this view by focusing on the role that signals coming from inside the body, such as heartbeats, may play in this referencing process. Specifically we show that private interoceptive sensations can be combined with affectively neutral information unrelated to the self to influence the processing of a multisensory percept. Results are discussed in terms of both standard multisensory integration processes and predictive coding theories.},

It was found that participants expected that about 50{\%} of the virtual judges gave them a positive judgment. Cardiac deceleration was strongest for unexpected social rejection. In contrast, the brain response was strongest to expected acceptance and was characterized by a positive deflection peaking around 325 ms following stimulus onset and the observed difference was maximal at fronto-central positions.

When there was a cultural match, participants showed improved emotional recovery, quicker return to baseline levels of cortisol, and greater persistence following the stressor.

In this framework, attention is thought to gate the influence of sensory information on perception. In contrast to exteroception, there is limited evidence for purely attentional effects on interoception. Here, we empirically tested if attentional focus modulates cortical processing of single heartbeats, using a newly-developed experimental paradigm to probe purely attentional differences between exteroceptive and interoceptive conditions in the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) using EEG recordings. We found that the HEP is significantly higher during interoceptive compared to exteroceptive attention, in a time window of 524–620 ms after the R-peak. Furthermore, this effect predicted self-report measures of autonomic system reactivity. Our study thus provides direct evidence that the HEP is modulated by pure attention and suggests that this effect may provide a clinically relevant readout for assessing interoception.},

abstract = {Background: Adolescence is a transition period from childhood to adulthood that is often characterized by emotional instability. This period is also a time of increased incidence of anxiety and depression, underscoring the importance of understanding biological substrates of behavioral and emotion regulation during adolescence. Developmental changes in the brain in concert with individual predispositions for anxiety might underlie the increased risk for poor outcomes reported during adolescence. We tested the hypothesis that difficulties in regulating behavior in emotional contexts in adolescents might be due to competition between heightened activity in subcortical emotional processing systems and immature top-down prefrontal systems. Individual differences in emotional reactivity might put some teens at greater risk during this sensitive transition in development. Methods: We examined the association between emotion regulation and frontoamygdala circuitry in 60 children, adolescents, and adults with an emotional go-nogo paradigm. We went beyond examining the magnitude of neural activity and focused on neural adaptation within this circuitry across time with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Adolescents showed exaggerated amygdala activity relative to children and adults. This age-related difference decreased with repeated exposures to the stimuli, and individual differences in self-ratings of anxiety predicted the extent of adaptation or habituation in amygdala. Individuals with higher trait anxiety showed less habituation over repeated exposures. This failure to habituate was associated with less functional connectivity between ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Conclusions: These findings suggest that exaggerated emotional reactivity during adolescence might increase the need for top-down control and put individuals with less control at greater risk for poor outcomes. ?? 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

We conclude that the evidence to support the LF/HF ratio as a potential marker of cardiac sympathetic control in epidemiology-scaled research is currently insufficient.},

For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

This is in part because of lack of nonlinear analysis of mathematical model based on the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) parameters. The paper provides substantial information about the mathematical and numerical analysis and synchronization of a multi-limit cycle oscillator from the RQA perspective. The recurrence quantification analysis parameters are used to discuss the birhythmic behavior of the system, as well as various bifurcations (quasi-periodicity, periodicity and chaos) in the system response. Finally, the results of the method of RPs are compared to those of phase diagrams and the problem of synchronization of limit cycle and chaotic response is discussed by the mean of cross recurrence. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The processing of interoceptive signals in the insular cortex is thought to underlie self-awareness. However, the influence of interoception on visual awareness and the role of the insular cortex in this process remain unclear. Here, we show in a series of experiments that the relative timing of visual stimuli with respect to the heartbeat modulates visual awareness. We used two masking techniques and show that conscious access for visual stimuli synchronous to participants' heartbeat is suppressed compared with the same stimuli presented asynchronously to their heartbeat. Two independent brain imaging experiments using high-resolution fMRI revealed that the insular cortex was sensitive to both visible and invisible cardio-visual stimulation, showing reduced activation for visual stimuli presented synchronously to the heartbeat. Our results show that interoceptive insular processing affects visual awareness, demonstrating the role of the insula in integrating interoceptive and exteroceptive signals and in the processing of conscious signals beyond self-awareness. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT There is growing evidence that interoceptive signals conveying information regarding the internal state of the body influence perception and self-awareness. The insular cortex, which receives sensory inputs from both interoceptive and exteroceptive sources, is thought to integrate these multimodal signals. This study shows that cardiac interoceptive signals modulate awareness for visual stimuli such that visual stimuli occurring at the cardiac frequency take longer to access visual awareness and are more difficult to discriminate. Two fMRI experiments show that the insular region is sensitive to this cardio-visual synchrony even when the visual stimuli are rendered invisible through interocular masking. The results indicate a perceptual and neural suppression for visual events coinciding with cardiac interoceptive signals.},

abstract = {It is widely accepted that emotions have utilitarian as well as hedonic consequences. Nevertheless, it is typically assumed that individuals regulate emotions to obtain hedonic, rather than utilitarian, benefits. In this study, the authors tested whether individuals represent the utility of pleasant and unpleasant emotions and whether they would be motivated to experience unpleasant emotions if they believed they could be useful. First, findings revealed that participants explicitly viewed approach emotions (e.g., excitement) as useful for obtaining rewards, but viewed avoidance emotions (e.g., worry) as useful for avoiding threats. Second, this pattern was replicated in implicit representations of emotional utility, which were dissociated from explicit ones. Third, implicit, but not explicit, representations of emotional utility predicted motives for emotion regulation. When anticipating a threatening task, participants who viewed emotions such as worry and fear as useful for avoiding threats preferred to engage in activities that were likely to increase worry and fear (vs. excitement) before the task. These findings demonstrate that utilitarian considerations play an important, if underappreciated, role in emotion regulation.},

abstract = {The relation between empathy (defined as the ability to perceive accurately how another person is feeling) and physiology was studied in 31 Ss. Ss viewed 15-min marital interactions and used a rating dial to indicate continuously how they thought a designated spouse was feeling. Rating accuracy was determined by comparing Ss' ratings with identical self-ratings obtained previously from the target spouse; Physiological linkage between S and target was determined using bivariate time-series analyses applied to 5 autonomic and somatic measures obtained from the S during the rating task and from the target spouse during the original conversation. Accuracy of rating negative emotion was greatest when S and target evidenced high levels of physiological linkage across time. Accuracy of detecting positive emotion was related to a state oflow cardiovascular arousal in the S, but not to physiological linkage between S and target. Empathy is a fundamental part of the social fabric of emo-tion, providing a bridge betweeri the feelings of one person and those of another. The notion that empathy between two people is related to a state of shared physiology is intriguing, suggesting a parallelism between psychological and physiological do-mains. The study of empathy has generated a large literature, often including physiological measurement, but almost always from a single person (either the person being observed or the observer, but not both). Shared physiology has generated a rela-tively small I iterature that has not addressed its relation with empathy.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that healthy participants learn to control local brain activity with operant training by using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI). Very little data exist, however, on the dynamics of interaction between critical brain regions during rt-fMRI-based training. Here, we examined self-regulation of stimulus-elicited insula activation and performed a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis of real-time self-regulation data. During voluntary up-regulation of the left anterior insula in the presence of threat-related pictures, differential activations were observed in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the frontal operculum, the middle cingulate cortex and the right insula. Down-regulation in comparison to no-regulation revealed additional activations in right superior temporal cortex, right inferior parietal cortex and right middle frontal cortex. There was a significant learning effect over sessions during up-regulation, documented by a significant improvement of anterior insula control over time. Connectivity analysis revealed that successful up-regulation of the activity in left anterior insula while viewing aversive pictures was directly modulated by dorsomedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Down-regulation of activity was more difficult to achieve and no learning effect was observed. More extensive training might be necessary for successful down-regulation. These findings illustrate the functional interactions between different brain areas during regulation of anterior insula activity in the presence of threat-related stimuli.},

This functional activity was greater than that observed for less intense emotional (i.e., happy families or angry faces) or neutral images (i.e., household objects, neutral faces). Both the extent and strength of functional activity were related to the judged affective arousal of the different picture contents, and the same pattern of functional activation was present whether pictures were presented in color or in grayscale. It is suggested that more extensive visual system activation reflects "motivated attention," in which appetitive or defensive motivational engagement directs attention and facilitates perceptual processing of survival-relevant stimuli.},

abstract = {Linear mixed-effect models (LMMs) are being increasingly widely used in psychology to analyse multi-level research designs. This feature allows LMMs to address some of the problems identified by Speelman and McGann (2013) about the use of mean data, because they do not average across individual responses. However, recent guidelines for using LMM to analyse skewed reaction time (RT) data collected in many cognitive psychological studies recommend the application of non-linear transformations to satisfy assumptions of normality. Uncritical adoption of this recommendation has important theoretical implications which can yield misleading conclusions. For example, Balota et al. (2013) showed that analyses of raw RT produced additive effects of word frequency and stimulus quality on word identification, which conflicted with the interactive effects observed in analyses of transformed RT. Generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) provide a solution to this problem by satisfying normality assumptions without the need for transformation. This allows differences between individuals to be properly assessed, using the metric most appropriate to the researcher's theoretical context. We outline the major theoretical decisions involved in specifying a GLMM, and illustrate them by reanalysing Balota et al.'s datasets. We then consider the broader benefits of using GLMM to investigate individual differences.},
